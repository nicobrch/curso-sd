of One Piece is populated by humans and other races such as dwarves more akin to faeries in size giants merfolk fishmen longlimbed tribes longnecked people known as the Snakeneck Tribe and animal people known as Minks The world is governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World Government consisting of dozens of member countries The Navy is the sea military branch of the World Government that protects the known seas from pirates and other criminals There is also Cipher Pol which is a group of agencies within the World Government that are their secret police While pirates are major opponents against the Government the ones who really challenge their rule are the Revolutionary Army who seeks to overthrow them The central tension of the series pits the World Government and their forces against pirates The series regularly emphasizes moral ambiguity over the label pirate which includes cruel villains but also any individuals that do not submit to the World Governments authoritarianand often morally ambiguousrule The One Piece world also has supernormal characteristics like Devil Fruits which are mysterious fruits that grant whoever eats them transformative powers Another supernatural power is Haki which grants its users enhanced willpower observation and fighting abilities and it is one of the only effective methods of inflicting bodily harm on certain Devil Fruit usersThe world itself consists of two vast oceans divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line Within the oceans is a second global phenomenon known as the Grand Line which is a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line and is bounded by the Calm Belt strips of calm ocean infested with huge shipeating monsters known as Sea Kings These geographical barriers divide the world into four seas North Blue East Blue West Blue and South Blue Passage between the four seas and the Grand Line is therefore difficult Unique and mystical features enable transport between the seas such as the use of Sea Prism Stone employed by government ships to mask their presence as they traverse the Calm Belt or the Reverse Mountain where water from the four seas flows uphill before merging into a rapidly flowing and dangerous canal that enters the Grand Line The Grand Line itself is split into two separate halves with the Red Line between being Paradise and the New WorldPremiseThe series focuses on Monkey D Luffya young man made of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruitwho sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D Rogers ultimate treasure known as the One Piece and take over his prior title In an effort to organize his own crew the Straw Hat Pirates Luffy rescues and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman named Roronoa Zoro and they head off in search of the titular treasure They are joined in their journey by Nami a moneyobsessed thief and navigator Usopp a sniper and compulsive liar and Sanji an amorous but chivalrous cook They acquire a ship the Going Merrylater replaced by the Thousand Sunnyand engage in confrontations with notorious pirates As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures others join the crew later in the series including Tony Tony Chopper an anthropomorphized reindeer doctor Nico Robin an archaeologist and former Baroque Works assassin Franky a cyborg shipwright Brook a skeleton musician and swordsman and Jimbei a whale sharktype fishman and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea who becomes their helmsman Together they encounter other pirates bounty hunters criminal organizations revolutionaries secret agents different types of scientists soldiers of the morallyambiguous World Government and various other friends and foes as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreamsProductionConcept and creationEiichiro Odas interest in pirates began in his childhood watching the animated series Vicky the Viking which inspired him to want to draw a manga series about pirates The reading of pirate biographies influenced Oda to incorporate the characteristics of reallife pirates into many of the characters in One Piece for example the character Marshall D Teach is based on and named after the historical pirate Edward Blackbeard Teach Apart from the history of piracy Odas biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series Dragon Ball which is one of his favorite manga He was also inspired by The Wizard of Oz claiming not to endure stories where the reward of adventure is the adventure itself opting for a story where travel is important but even more important is the goalWhile working as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki Oda began writing One Piece in  It started as two oneshot stories entitled Romance Dawnwhich would later be used as the title for One Pieces first chapter and volume They both featured the character of Luffy and included elements that would appear later in the main series The first of these short stories was published in August  in Akamaru Jump and later in One Piece Red The second was published in the st issue of Weekly Shnen Jump in  and reprinted in  in Odas short story collection Wanted In an interview with TBS Takanori Asada the original editor of One Piece revealed that the manga was rejected by Weekly Shnen Jump three times before Shueisha agreed to publish the seriesDevelopmentWhen creating the Devil Fruit Oda thinks of something that would fulfill a human desire he added that he does not see why he would draw a Devil Fruit unless the fruits appearance would entice one to eat it The names of many special attacks as well as other concepts in the manga consist of a form of punning in which phrases written in kanji are paired with an idiosyncratic reading The names of some characters techniques are often mixed with other languages and the names of several of Zoros sword techniques are designed as jokes they look fearsome when read by sight but sound like kinds of food when read aloud For example Zoros signature move is Onigiri which is written as demon cut but is pronounced the same as rice ball in Japanese Eisaku Inoue the animation director has said that the creators did not use these kanji readings in the anime since they might have cut down the laughs by about half Nevertheless Konosuke Uda the director said that he believes that the creators made the anime pretty close to the mangaOda was sensitive about how his work would be translated In many instances the English version of the One Piece manga uses one onomatopoeia for multiple onomatopoeia used in the Japanese version For instance saaa the sound of light rain close to a mist and zaaa the sound of pouring rain are both translated as fshhhhhhh Unlike other manga artists Oda draws everything that moves himself to create a consistent look while leaving his staff to draw the backgrounds based on sketches he has drawn This workload forces him to keep tight production rates starting from five in the morning until two in the morning the next day with short breaks only for meals Odas work program includes the first three days of the week dedicated to the writing of the storyboard and the remaining time for the definitive inking of the boards and for the possible coloring When a reader asked who Nami was in love with Oda replied that there would hardly be any love affairs within Luffys crew The author also explained he deliberately avoids including them in One Piece since the series is a shnen manga and the boys who read it are not interested in love storiesConclusionOda revealed that he originally planned One Piece to last five years and that he had already planned the ending However he found it would take longer than he had expected as Oda realized that he liked the story too much to end it in that period of time In  nineteen years after the start of serialization the author said that the manga has reached  of the story he intends to tell In July  on the occasion of the twentyfirst anniversary of One Piece Oda said that the manga has reached  of the plot while in January  he said that One Piece is on its way to the conclusion but that it could exceed the th volume In August  Oda said that according to his predictions the manga will end between  and  However Oda stated that the ending would be what he had decided in the beginning he is committed to seeing it through In a television special aired in Japan Oda said he would be willing to change the ending if the fans were to be able to predict it In August  Shueisha

showing more North American influence than that from its Japanese origins adding that the artwork and settings come across as timeless in their presentation He also notes that the influence of Akira Toriyama Dragon Ball shines through in Odas style of writing with its huge epic battles punctuated by a lot of humor and that in One Piece he manages to share a rich tale without getting bogged down

could get too crowded for easy reading The website activeAnime describes the artwork in One Piece as wonderfully quirky and full of expression Mario Vuk from Splash Comics commented that Odas pleasantly bright and dynamic art style suits the storys funny and exciting atmosphere Isaiah Colbert of Kotaku called One Piece a masterpiece highlighting Odas character writing worldbuilding and the balance between fun and serious subject matter Dale Bashir of IGN wrote that One Piece is more about the worldbuilding adventuring and the meaning of freedom instead of the usual shonen battling from series like Dragon Ball and Naruto Bashir concluded While not everyone would want to go so far for a franchise that isnt even finished yet trust me when I say that it is definitely worth itEX Media

the series for English Shonen Jump said that while doing so her amazement over Odas craft grew steadily She states that he has a natural playful mastery of the often restrictive weeklymanga format
