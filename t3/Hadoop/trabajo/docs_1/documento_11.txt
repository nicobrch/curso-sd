civilization Its inhabitants known as Eldians have been led to believe that over one hundred years ago humanity was driven to the brink of extinction after the emergence of humanoid giants called Titans who attack and eat humans on sight The last remnants of humanity retreated behind three concentric walls and enjoyed roughly a century of peace Within the walls the thought of venturing outside is strongly frowned upon and discouraged To combat Titans the countrys military employs Vertical Maneuvering Equipment VME also called OmniDirectional Maneuvering Gear ODM Gear a set of waistmounted grappling hooks and gaspowered propulsion enabling immense mobility in three dimensions Swords made of ultrahard steel are used in conjunction with the gear and eventually rocket launcherlike weapons called Thunder Spears are also developedThere exist different types of Titans Pure Titans are the weakest and most generic Titans whose behavior is easy to predict making them easy to kill Abnormal Titans are Pure Titans whose behavior is more difficult to predict making them far more dangerous The Nine Titans also known as Titan Shifters Attack Colossal Armored Female Beast Jaw Cart War Hammer and Founding are the strongest Titans each is able to shift back and forth between human and Titan form to access their Titans abilities Many Titan Shifters also possess the ability to harden certain parts of their bodies at will typically in order to make them virtually impenetrable or to strengthen their blows during combatPure Titans are created by injecting Eldians with Titan spinal fluid If a Pure Titan eats the human body of a person who possesses one of the Nine Titans said Eldian will revert to human form and gain that Shifters powers whereupon they are cursed to live only  more years If their powers are not inherited by another Eldian before their death their powers will be inherited by an Eldian baby born shortly thereafter regardless of distance or bloodrelations As the story progresses the true nature of the Titans and the existence of civilization outside the walls is revealed to the characters and the audiencePlotEren Yeager is a boy who lives in the town of Shiganshina located on the outermost of three circular walls which protect their inhabitants from Titans In the year  the first wall Wall Maria is breached by two new types of Titans the Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan During the incident Erens mother is eaten by a Smiling Titan while Eren escapes He swears revenge on all Titans and enlists in the military along with his childhood friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin ArlertFive years after Shiganshinas fall the Colossal Titan attacks the city of Trost located in the second innermost wall Wall Rose Eren helps to successfully defend the city after he discovers a mysterious ability to turn himself into a sentient Attack Titan Additionally he regains memories of his father giving him this ability shortly after the fall of Wall Maria and telling him that the truth about their world can be found in their basement in Shiganshina These events draw the attention of the Survey Corps and their commander Erwin Smith who intend to use his power to reclaim Wall Maria and reach the Yeagers basement Eren Mikasa and Armin are transferred to the Special Operations Squad under the care of Levi Ackerman and Hange Zo During an expedition into the forest between the walls Eren and his companions encounter a sentient Female Titan whom they later expose as their fellow military comrade Annie Leonhart With help from his friends Eren fights and defeats Annie who encases herself in crystal and is put in custody After the fight it is discovered that there are Titans lying dormant within the walls known as Wall TitansShortly thereafter Pure Titans mysteriously appear within Wall Rose with no evidence of how they got in accompanied by the sentient Beast Titan Ymir one of the new Survey Corps graduates reveals that she can also transform into the sentient Jaw Titan while Ymirs close friend Krista Lenz reveals herself as Historia Reiss a member of the royal family Two other members of the Survey Corps Reiner Braun and Bertholt Hoover reveal themselves as the Armored and Colossal Titan respectively They attempt to kidnap Eren and Ymir but fail In the ensuing battle Eren discovers another power within himself called the Coordinate that allows him to control other Titans which he uses to kill the Smiling Titan and send a horde of Pure Titans to attack Reiner and Bertholt This forces the two to escape whereupon Ymir willingly flees with them offering herself as sacrifice to prevent Historia from being targeted by the enemy In the aftermath of these events it is determined that the Pure Titans who suddenly appeared within Wall Rose were the inhabitants of various villages within Wall Rose who had in some way been transformed into Titans This leads the characters to the conclusion that all Pure Titans are in fact transformed human beingsEren and his friends join Levi Squad while the Survey Corps is targeted by the Military Police led by Kenny Ackerman Levis uncle In the occasion they discover that by transforming into a Pure Titan via a serum made of Titan spinal fluid and eating another Titan shifter a person can gain its abilities and that Historia and her father Rod Reiss are the only surviving members of the royal bloodline Rod kidnaps Eren because he is in possession of the Founding Titan obtained by his father Grisha upon eating Frieda Reiss Historias halfsister and by Eren through eating his father Rod tries to convince Historia to allow herself to be transformed into a Titan so she can eat Eren and regain the Founders power After Historia refuses and breaks Rods vial of spinal fluid Rod attempts to consume the serum himself transforming into a monstrously large Abnormal Titan and inadvertently killing Kenny he is then killed by Historia with the help of the Survey Corps who is thereafter declared QueenHaving resolved the political unrest the Survey Corps lead a successful operation to recapture Shiganshina fighting the Beast Colossal Armored and Cart Titans but suffering massive casualties wherein Erwin dies in a suicide run against the Beast Titan and Armin gains ownership of the Colossal Titan when Levi injects him with a serum given by Kenny causing Armin to eat Bertholt Eren and his companions return to his childhood home where they discover the truth of their world they are actually Eldians sworn enemies of the conquering Marleyans who were enclosed within the walls after the original King Karl Fritz fled from the war They are not the last humans as they were told but rather an enclosed sect of Eldians on an isolated island called Paradis Because they are Subjects of Ymir who can be turned into Titans by being injected with Titan spinal fluid the Eldians continue to be oppressed by Marley In the year after the battle of Shiganshina the Survey Corps kill all of the remaining Pure Titans on the islandThree years later the Survey Corps launch an attack against the Marleyan capital of Liberio orchestrated by Eren and his halfbrother Zeke who is the owner of the Beast Titan Eren kills Willy Tybur an Eldian who along with his family had been controlling Marley from the shadows and gains ownership of the War Hammer Titan after eating its previous owner Willys sister Lara However Eren is imprisoned for acting against orders but escapes with a faction of extremist Paradis soldiers called the Yeagerists Zeke is kept in Levis custody but manages to escape severely injuring but not killing him Marleys air fleet led by Reiner launch an invasion of Paradis and chaos breaks out in the ensuing battle Eren and Zeke reunite which leads them to the Pathsa series of atemporal gateways connecting all Eldians through time and space There they meet the consciousness of Ymir Fritzthe original Titanwhose tortured past led to her imprisonment within the Paths for thousands of years Zeke attempts to convince Ymir to fulfill his wish to stop the Subjects of Ymir from reproducing via mass sterilization However Eren convinces Ymir to use her power to bring about the Rumblingunleashing thousands of Wall Titans kept within Paradiss walls and leading them on a genocidal march to kill everyone outside the islandThe Survey Corps ally with remaining Marleyan forces including Reiner and a nowfreed Annie to stop Eren and they defeat the Yeagerists before confronting Eren though many are killed including Hange Levi kills Zeke and Mikasa kills Eren which causes the mysterious creature that is the source of all Titans powers to die and the power of the Titans to vanish reverting all Titans to human form and stripping the Titan Shifters of their powers thereby freeing all Eldians from the curse His death also releases memory blocks that he put on his friends revealing that what transpired was part of Erens plan to spare twenty percent of humanity with Armin Levi Mikasa and the others being recognized as heroes in the eyes of the world for killing him and stopping the Rumbling Three years later as Paradis and the rest of the world rebuilds Armin and his allies begin peace negotiations led by Queen Historia Mikasa buries Eren underneath a tree on a hill near Shiganshina District The tree grows over time to resemble the one where the organism that granted Ymir her Titan power lived An unspecified amount of time after Mikasas death from old age a modernized Shiganshina is reduced to rubble in a war The series ends with a boy and his dog approaching the tree which has now become surrounded by wildernessProductionHajime Isayama created a page oneshot version of Attack on Titan in  Originally he offered his work to the

young people in todays society Writer Mao Yamawaki called it a comingofage story of the boys and girls at its core with a new mystery every episode It is these mysteries that critic Tomofusa Kure said amplifies readers expectations The artwork of the manga has been criticized as crude by some reviewers with Isayama himself admitting his drawings are amateurish However those same critics stated that after years of serialization the art has been improving and Kure believes that had the illustrations been refined it would not have conveyed the eeriness that is a key characteristic of the work In a

General Akiyama Yoshifuru whose war record included atrocities during Japanese occupation of Korea and China such as allowing the Port Arthur massacre to occur An Internet flame war about the general and his influence on the character ensued on Isayamas blog and included death threats to the author As many of the threats written in Japanese had grammatical errors Japanese media outlets claimed that they were written by nonnative speakers of Japanese In  the Chinese Ministry of Culture listed Attack on Titan as one of the  animemanga titles banned in ChinaCritical interpretations of Attack on Titan highlight characteristics shared by the race of Eldians and the Jewish people noting their persecution by Marleyans as similar to the Jewish persecution by Nazi Germany This has led to accusations and theories of antisemitism and fascism apology against the series and its author Isayama including claims that Isayama is promoting nationalism and the conspiracy theory of Jewish global
