the idea for Bakuman after thinking of all the people who long to be manga artists Because he is in the industry he felt he could create a manga about manga Takeshi Obata illustrator of the series said that the title means bakuhatsu explosion bakuchi gamble and baku an animal that supposedly eats dreams It has many meanings to it and I think its a very fun title Ohba said that for the fictional manga created in the series he did not worry about the plot and settings only focusing on cranking them out He revealed that he did actually make storyboards for the fictional The Classroom of Truth and one he created for Otter No  is actually seen in BakumanWhen creating a chapter Ohba did not meet with Obata He would discuss things with his editor and create storyboards that were given to Obata Obata then would create his own storyboards that were given to Ohba and their editor The author said only minor changes were ever made and they never had disagreements Obata said that when he started the manga he struggled with the large amount of dialogue and information not having enough space to draw the detailed backgrounds that he wanted But he eventually realized that the dialogue is the main character of the series and shifted to making the art as unobtrusive as possible such as using simple camera angles so that the composition was not too elaborate and the text could be read smoothly Ohba referred to Bakuman as a weird series He revealed that the hardest part was coming up with new ideas as the story kept getting longer But said because of this he was able to include stories that he never initially consideredWhen asked how accurate the manga process depicted in Bakuman is to reality current Weekly Shnen Jump editorinchief Hiroyuki Nakano said that as a work of fiction some things are exaggerated for dramatic effect But it takes a lot of details from real life so I think its quite close Bakuman features many homages to Fujiko A Fujios Manga Michi a

Thompson referred to Bakuman as a love letter to the manga industry done in oldschool shonen manga style He felt that while it can be textheavy on the process of making manga it is ultimately a heroic story of selfimprovement friendship and striving to succeed Thompson cited the villain characters as the most interesting but called the series sexist for only portraying females as either bitter manhating viragos motivated by grudges against men or patient helpmates striving to support them instead Carlo Santos of Anime News Network was surprised that Bakuman succeeds not only as a manga about manga but as a sliceoflife story about the dreams of youth Although he praised the conflicting viewpoints of the protagonists Santos remarked that the series could learn from Ohba and Obatas previous serial Death Note commenting that the beginning is not as gripping and the plot twists are pretty weak and seem like petty contrivances Despite this he believes that the series is another hit Allegra Frank of Polygon seems to disagree with Santos criticism calling Bakuman a sweet funny pageturner that is gripping right from the start just like Death Note only in a completely different far more lowkey wayChristopher Butcher reviewing volume one for Aboutcom had strong praise for the art calling it quite possibly the bestdrawn manga out today He also enjoyed the behindthescenes information on the manga industry Like Thompson Butcher did state that while he enjoyed it he has reservations about recommending Bakuman because it is horribly sexist In an article discussing the underdevelopment of its female lead characters Gregory Segal of Comic Book Resources wrote that some fans speculate the series inclusion of such tropes is a form of metacommentary on the traditional portrayal of women in shnen mangaThe film was numberone at the Japanese box office on its opening weekend with US million It earned US million during the October  weekend At the th Japan Academy Prize awards its editor Yasuyuki zeki won the Japan Academy Prize for Best Film Editing award while Sakanactions Motion Music of Bakuman won the Outstanding Achievement in Music award The film was also one

and the best liveaction manga adaptation hes seen this year Kotakus Toshi Nakamura also suggested that it is possibly the best liveaction manga adaptation hes seen However he said the motivational romance between Mashiro and Azuki was surprisingly inconsequential and boring Mark Schilling for The Japan Times gave the film four out of five stars with strong praise for director and screenwriter
