and characters In his  book Manga The Complete Guide Jason Thompson described its storyline as an almost random collection of psychouts battles puzzles and trickery that works on both a chapterbychapter basis and a larger scale Thompson elaborated that with all the goals and subplots of each of the main characters the story could seemingly go on forever and is unpredictable enough to hold reader interest In a different review for Anime News Network in  Thompson wrote that it was hard to summarize the story because it is every shnen manga in one with training sequences tournament battles a crimemystery story arc and a virtualreality RPGstyle story arc But unlike most shnen manga he called Hunter  Hunter incredibly dense Examples being its fictional nen ability which is explained so thoroughly that you almost think it could exist and the little challenges and games the characters face Over and over Togashi invents some little closed system or rules just so the heroes can break them if he ever wants to change careers Id suggest game designer Thompson praised the character art as great pointing out how instead of alternating between realistic and chibi like other artists Togashi has cartoony and realistic characters interacting in the same panels Thompson did note how the artwork during its magazine run is often sketchy and missing backgrounds but that Togashi goes back and fixes it for its collected tankbon release Mentioning Togashis love of gore he stated the whole manga is about the mixture of childish adventure and creepy adult themes and noted how some panels later in the manga are apparently censored for gore by being covered with screentoneReviewing the first story arc Chris Sims of ComicsAlliance called Hunter  Hunter one of the most fun ridiculous and ludicrously violent comics Ive ever read He stated that while it has every idea about shnen manga in force what sticks out the most is the violence Sims summed it up as full of clever setups and characters that while simple to the point of almost seeming onedimensional at times still manage to be solid and entertaining based on their reaction to the increasingly strange increasingly deadly events around them Charles Solomon a writer for The New York Times and Los Angeles Times praised the moral seriousness of Gon a quality that gives the protagonist an appeal his relentlessly upbeat counterparts lack Publishers Weekly gave a positive review to the first volume of the manga stating that Togashi shows a deft touch with its standard story calling his artwork clear and graceful and mentioning that his characters are endearing and complex While Rika Takahashi of EXorg and Claude J Pelletier of Protoculture Addicts found the art style in Hunter  Hunter to be much simpler than Togashis two previous serializations Level E and YuYu Hakusho both reviewers appreciated the intricate narrative and charactersAnime seriesThe first Hunter  Hunter anime series has enjoyed much more modest popularity than its manga source Newtype listed it as having a Japanese television rating of  for the fourth quarter of  The shows viewership was ranked number six among the top ten anime television series in Japan for February  The series was voted as the th best anime of  in the Anime Grand Prix but rose to fourth place the following year In  the staff of the magazine listed Hunter  Hunter as the th most important anime of all time In a  web poll conducted in Japan by the network TV Asahi the Hunter  Hunter television series was voted th best anime of all time In  Maniacoms Briana Lawrence listed Hunter  Hunter at number nine of the websites  Anime Series That Need a RebootCritical reception for the first Hunter  Hunter television adaptation has been generally favorable Miyako Matsuda of Protoculture Addicts Carl Kimlinger of the Anime News Network and Derrick L Tucker of THEM Anime Reviews all expressed positive views of the series narrative and characters Matsuda admired the adventurefilled world of Hunter  Hunter and the practical character qualities of friendship effort and victory inserted by Togashi Beginning with the second Viz DVD volume Kimlinger summarized Togashis plotting is canny and occasionally insightful and Furuhashis visuals inventive yet attuned to the measured pacing of the series Together they create a shonen action series that is both fun to watch and curiously respectful of its audiences intelligence A strange combination indeed Tucker admitted to being bewitched by the series mainly due to the remarkable and original characters especially the interplay between the vastly different personalities of the Phantom Troupe members Kimlinger gave particular praise to the characteristics of the complex villain Hisoka and the deep emotional transformation of Kurapika in the latter half of the series Theron Martin of Anime News Network found the first fifteen episodes entertainment and stated Gon also inherits Gokus inherent likability some of the part of the challenge is figuring out what the challenge is bits are rather clever and setting up a situation where a tournament proctor is actually called out for being in the wrong is a nice twist It does also have some fun momentsThe art and animation of the Hunter  Hunter anime have also been commended by the press Kimlinger and Tucker were impressed by the art direction of Hunter  Hunter the former of whom critiquing the adaptation of Togashis work by Furuhashi as having understated energy and flair making the most of the eras  mix of traditional and CG animation to bring Gon and friends physical feats to fluid exhilarating life Martin faulted both the artwork and the subtle differences in character design The artistry not only shows its age but in fact looks older than it actually is the reviewer commented hearkening back to a day when digital coloring and CG enhancements were not ubiquitous and allowances for a rougher look were greater Opinions of the series sound and music have been somewhat mixed Martin positively noted the soundtrack as the strongest production point of Hunter  Hunter and was satisfied with both the English translation of the script and Oceans voice overs Tucker found the music satisfactory and improved as the series progressed but did not think it lived up to its potential Kimlinger agreeably felt the musical score to be appropriate in most instances but criticized the English dub as a letdown since day one seriesMadhouses  adaptation was met with nearuniversal critical acclaim Adrian Marcano from Inverse considered Hunter x Hunter  to be one of the greatest anime series ever He said that the anime set itself apart with one of the greatest story arcs in anime history in which the villain not the hero takes the anime to instant classic status He also said that It is in the  version where we see probably one of the best story arcs in anime history the Chimera Ant Arc According to Movie News Guide and Latin Post the Madhouses  version received more viewers not only in Japan but also around the world particularly in North America Digital Fox Medias Michael Basile of Fox Sports Digital Media praised the animation quality of the new adaptation the animation actually appears to get better and better as the series progresses The color palette can shift from vibrant and inviting to grim and menacing at the drop of a hat the character designs are unique and appealing the CG is very minimal and the action sequences are some of the best that the shnen genre has ever produced onpar with the best works of Studio Bones Its almost miraculous how consistently beautiful this anime is He also considered it to be one of the best anime of all time Nick Creamer held similar sentiments writing the shows fantastic aesthetics elevate it above almost everything out there  in direction in sound design in pacing in animation in basically every relevant aesthetic metric Hunter x Hunter triumphs That its been maintaining this level of quality for well over a hundred episodes is nothing short of astonishingIn  Polygon named the series as one of the best anime of the s and Crunchyroll listed it in their Top  best anime of the s IGN also listed the Hunter  Hunter  adaptation among the best anime series of the sNotesReferencesBibliographyThompson Jason  Manga The
