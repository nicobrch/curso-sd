humanity has colonized most of the rocky planets and moons of the Solar System Amid a rising crime rate the Inter Solar System Police ISSP set up a legalized contract system in which registered bounty

Spike Spiegel an exiled former hitman of the criminal Red Dragon Syndicate and Jet Black a former ISSP officer They are later joined by Faye Valentine an amnesiac con artist Edward an eccentric child skilled in hacking and Ein a geneticallyengineered Pembroke Welsh Corgi with humanlike intelligence Over the course of the series the team get involved in disastrous mishaps leaving them without money while often confronting faces and events from their past these include Jets reasons for leaving the ISSP and Fayes past as a young woman from Earth injured in an accident and cryogenically frozen to save her lifeWhile much of the show is episodic in nature the main story arc focuses on Spike and his deadly rivalry with Vicious an ambitious criminal affiliated with the Red Dragon Syndicate Spike and Vicious were once partners and friends but when Spike began an affair with Viciouss girlfriend Julia and resolved to leave the Syndicate with her Vicious sought to eliminate Spike by blackmailing

ends with Spike killing Vicious only to be seriously wounded himself in the ensuing confrontation Looking up to the sky Spike sees Julia The series concludes as Spike descends the main staircase of the building into the rising sun before eventually falling to the groundGenre and themesWatanabe created a special tagline for the series to promote it during its original presentation calling it a new genre unto itself The line was inserted before and after commercial breaks during its Japanese and US broadcasts Later Watanabe called the phrase an exaggeration The show is a hybrid of multiple genres including westerns and pulp fiction One reviewer described it as space opera meets noir meets comedy meets cyberpunk It has also been called a genrebusting space WesternThe musical style was emphasized in many of the episode titles Multiple philosophical themes are explored using the characters including existentialism existential boredom loneliness and the effect of the past on the protagonists Other concepts referenced include environmentalism and capitalism The series also makes specific references to or pastiches multiple films including the works of John Woo and Bruce Lee Midnight Run  A Space Odyssey and Alien The series also includes extensive references and elements from science fiction bearing strong similarities to the cyberpunk fiction of William Gibson Several planets and space stations in the series are made in Earths image The streets of celestial objects such as Ganymede resemble a modern port city while Mars features shopping malls theme parks casinos and cities Cowboy Bebops universe is filled with video players and hyperspace gates ecopolitics and fairgrounds spaceships and Native American shamans This setting has been described as one part Chinese diaspora and two parts wild westCharactersThe characters were created by Watanabe and character designed by Toshihiro Kawamoto Watanabe envisioned each character as an extension of his own personality or as an opposite person to himself Each character from the main cast to supporting characters were designed to be outlaws unable to fit into society Kawamoto designed the characters so they were easily distinguished from one another All the main cast are characterized by a deep sense of loneliness or resignation to their fate and past From the perspective of Brian Camp and Julie Davis the main characters resemble the main characters of the anime series Lupin III if only superficially given their more troubled pasts and more complex personalitiesThe show focuses on the character of Spike Spiegel voiced by Kichi Yamadera an iconic space cowboy with green hair and often seen wearing a blue suit with the overall theme of the series being Spikes past and its karmic effect on him Spike was portrayed as someone who had lost his expectations for the future having lost the woman he loved and so was in a nearconstant lethargy Spikes artificial eye was included as Watanabe wanted his characters to have flaws He was originally going to be given an eyepatch but this decision was vetoed by producersJet voiced by Unsh Ishizuka is shown as someone who lost confidence in his former life and has become cynical about the state of society Spike and Jet were designed to be opposites with Spike being thin and wearing smart attire while Jet was bulky and wore more casual clothing The clothing which was dark in color also reflected their states of mind Faye Valentine Edward Wong voiced by Aoi Tada and Ein joined the crew in later episodes Their designs were intended to contrast against Spike Faye was described by her voice actress Megumi Hayashibara as initially being an ugly woman with her defining traits being her liveliness sensuality and humanity To emphasize her situation when first introduced she was compared to Poker Alice a famous Western figureEdward and Ein were the only main characters to have reallife models The former had her behavior based on the antics of Yoko Kanno as observed by Watanabe when he first met her While generally portrayed as carefree and eccentric Edward is motivated by a sense of loneliness after being abandoned by her father Kawamoto initially based Eins design on a friends pet corgi later getting one himself to use as a motion modelProductionCowboy Bebop was developed by animation studio Sunrise and created by Hajime Yatate the wellknown pseudonym for the collective contributions of Sunrises animation staff The leader of the series creative team was director Shinichir Watanabe most notable at the time for directing Macross Plus and Mobile Suit Gundam  Stardust Memory Other leading members of Sunrises creative team were screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto mechanical art designer Kimitoshi Yamane composer Yoko Kanno and producers Masahiko Minami and Yoshiyuki Takei Most of them had previously worked together in addition to having credits on other popular anime titles Nobumoto had scripted Macross Plus Kawamoto had designed the characters for Gundam and Kanno had composed the music for Macross Plus and The Vision of Escaflowne Yamane had not worked with Watanabe yet but his credits in anime included Bubblegum Crisis and The Vision of Escaflowne Minami joined the project as he wanted to do something different from his previous work on mecha animeConceptCowboy Bebop was Watanabes first project as solo director as he had been codirector in his previous works His original concept was for a movie and during production he treated each episode as a miniature movie His main inspiration for Cowboy Bebop was the first series of the anime Lupin III a crime drama focusing on the exploits of the series titular character When developing the series story Watanabe began by creating the characters first He explained the first image that occurred to me was one of Spike and from there I tried to build a story around him trying to make him cool While the original dialogue of the series was kept clean to avoid any profanities its level of sophistication was made appropriate to adults in a criminal environment Watanabe described Cowboy Bebop as  serious story and  humorous touch The comical episodes were harder for the team to write than the serious ones and though several events in them seemed random they were carefully planned in advance Watanabe conceived the series ending early on and each episode involving Spike and Vicious was meant to foreshadow their final confrontation Some of the staff were unhappy about this approach as a continuation of the series would be difficult While he considered altering the ending he eventually settled with his original idea The reason for creating the ending was that Watanabe did not want the series to become like Star Trek with him being tied to doing it for yearsDevelopmentThe project had initially originated with Bandais toy division as a sponsor with the goal of selling spacecraft toys Watanabe recalled his only instruction was So long as theres a spaceship in it you can do whatever you want But upon viewing early footage it became clear that Watanabes vision for the series did not match Bandais Believing the series would never sell toy merchandise Bandai pulled out of the project leaving it in development hell until sister company Bandai Visual stepped in to sponsor it Since there was no need to merchandise toys with the property any more Watanabe had free rein in the development of the series Watanabe wanted to design not just a space adventure series for adolescent boys but a program that would also appeal to sophisticated adults During the making of Bebop Watanabe often attempted to rally the animation staff by telling them that the show would be something memorable up to three decades later While some of them were doubtful of that at the time Watanabe many years later expressed his happiness to have been proven right in retrospect He joked that if Bandai Visual had not intervened then you might be seeing me working the supermarket checkout counter right nowThe city locations were generally inspired by the cities of New York and Hong Kong The atmospheres of the planets and the ethnic groups in Cowboy Bebop mostly originated from Watanabes ideas with some collaboration from set designers Isamu Imakake Shoji Kawamori and Dai Sat The animation staff established the particular planet atmospheres early in the production of the series before working on the ethnic groups It was Watanabe who wanted to have several groups of ethnic diversity appear in the series Mars was the planet most often used in Cowboy Bebops storylines with Satoshi Toba the cultural and setting producer explaining that the other planets were unexpectedly difficult to use He stated that each planet in the series had unique features and the producers had to take into account the characteristics of each planet in the story For the final episode Toba explained that it was not possible for the staff to have the dramatic rooftop scene occur on Venus so the staff ended up normally falling back to Mars In creating the backstory Watanabe envisioned a world that was multinational rather than stateless In spite of certain American influences in the series he stipulated that the country had been destroyed decades prior to the story later saying the notion of the United States as the center of the world repelled himMusicThe music for Cowboy Bebop was composed by Yoko Kanno Kanno formed the blues and jazz band Seatbelts to perform the series music According to Kanno the music was one of the first aspects of the series to begin production before most of the characters story or animation had been finalized The genres she used for its composition were western opera and jazz Watanabe noted that Kanno did not score the music exactly the way he told her to He stated She gets inspired on her own follows up on her own imagery and comes to me saying this is the song we need for Cowboy Bebop and composes something completely on her own Kanno herself was sometimes surprised at how pieces of her music were used in scenes sometimes wishing it had been used elsewhere though she also felt that none of their uses were inappropriate She was pleased with the working environment finding the team very relaxed in comparison with other teams she had worked withWatanabe further explained that he would take inspiration from Kannos music after listening to it and create new scenes for the story from it These new scenes in turn would inspire Kanno and give her new ideas for the music and she would come to Watanabe with even more music Watanabe cited as an example some songs in the second half of the series we didnt even ask her for those songs she just made them and brought them to us He commented that while Kannos method was normally unforgivable and unacceptable it was ultimately a big hit with Cowboy Bebop Watanabe described his collaboration with Kanno as a game of catch between the two of us in developing the music and creating the TV series Cowboy Bebop Since the series broadcast Kanno and the Seatbelts have released seven original soundtrack albums two singles and extended plays and two compilations through label Victor EntertainmentWeaponsThe guns on the show were chosen by the director Watanabe and in discussion with set designer Isamu Imakake and mechanical designer Kimitoshi Yamane Setting producer Satoshi Toba said They talked about how they didnt want common guns because that wouldnt be very interesting and so they decided on these gunsDistributionBroadcastCowboy Bebop debuted on TV Tokyo one of the main broadcasters of anime in Japan airing from April  until June   Due to its  pm timeslot and depictions of graphic violence the

the main focus being on its style and mixture of genres Miguel Douglas describing the series style in a review said that the series distinctly establishes itself outside the realm of conventional Japanese animation and instead chooses to forge its own path With a setting within the realm of science fiction the series wisely offers a world that seems entirely realistic considering our present time Free from many of the elements that accompany science fiction in generalwhether that be space aliens giant robots or laser gunsthe series delegates itself towards presenting a world that is quite similar to our own albeit showcasing some technological advances Certainly not as pristine a future we would see in other series or films Cowboy Bebop decides to deliver a future that closely reflects that of our own time This aspect of familiarity does wonders in terms of relating to the viewer and it presents a world that certainly resembles our very own Daryl Surat of Otaku USA commenting on the series appeal said that it was that rare breed of sciencefiction accessible Unlike many anime titles viewers werent expected to have knowledge of Japanese culturecharacter names signs and the like were primarily in English to begin withor have seen any other anime series prior Michelle Onley Pirkle in her book Science Fiction Film Television and Adaptation Across the Screens said that Cowboy Bebop is taking a new take on genre not by creating unique images and sounds but by playing freely with remixing or adapting the images and sounds of other familiar genres in a dynamic way Robert Baigent writing for the Graduate Journal of AsiaPacific Studies said that the series appeal likely stemmed from the trend in anime to emulate Western fictionLegacyIn March  the print and web editions of The Onions The AV Club called Cowboy Bebop rightly a huge hit and listed it as a gateway series to understanding the medium of anime as a whole Suskind said It was unlike anything the genre had seen before It even approached its music differently The show kicked off with a wormhole of a theme song and the soundtrack moves so seamlessly through genres from rock to country to pop to jazz to funk its shocking to learn that one set of musicians is behind it all In an interview producer Sean Akins also states that the series created a whole new world Its hard for me to quantify the impact that I think it has had It changed anime I think people began to think about what shows would be cool I think it redefined cool within animation not only in Japan but in the States One of the series main animators Tensai Okamura went on to create his own anime in  Darker than Black Okamura used his experience from Cowboy Bebop to write the screenplay of Darker than Black leading to narratives composed of two episodes similar to Japanese dramasAmerican film director screenwriter and producer Rian Johnson has cited Cowboy Bebop as a visual influence on his films most notably Brick Enders Game writer Orson Scott Card also praised the series He states that the series is better than most scifi films out there He goes on to say that he found this series brilliant but what held me was a combination of strong relationshipbased storytelling a moody visual style that never got old and really smart dialogueAfter the creation of the series an interviewer asked Watanabe if he had any plans to create more Cowboy Bebop material Watanabe responded by saying that he does not believe that he should just keep on making Cowboy Bebop sequels for the sake of it Watanabe added that ending production and to quit while were ahead when people still want more is more in keeping with the Bebop spirit In a more recent interview from  with The Daily Texan Watanabe was asked if there would ever be more Cowboy Bebop Watanabes answer was somedaymaybe somedayIn May  composer Mason Lieberman who has never actually seen Cowboy Bebop partnered with Sunrise and Funimation to produce an official Cowboy Bebop charity track for COVID relief This track was released on vinyl and featured the return of original series composer Yko Kanno original recording band The Seatbelts and a
