creating the characters and premise during his work on Cowboy Bebop The Movie and The Animatrix and began preproduction in  The staff included character designer and animation director Kazuto Nakazawa and writers Shinji Obara and Yukihiko Tsutsumi of Office Crescendo The music was composed by hip hop artists Shinji Tsutchie Tsuchida of Shakkazombie Fat Jon Nujabes and Force of Nature The production was unstructured with the scenario going through multiple revisions and Watanabe bringing in multiple guest creators to ensure a high animation quality Reception of the series has been positive with praise focusing on its animation and music and proved a commercial success in the WestPlotSamurai Champloo opens in a small town where Fuu working as a tea waitress is harassed by the son of the towns corrupt prefect The outlaw Mugen arrives in town and Fuu begs him for protection which he gives in exchange for food Meanwhile the ronin Jin also a new arrival kills the prefects bodyguards when they abuse a peasant ending up in conflict with Mugen when the latter mistakes him for one of the prefects men The twos fight ends up destroying the teahouse The pair are captured and sentenced to death but Fuu saves them The pair attempt to restart their battle but Fuu tosses a coin saying if it lands on heads then the pair can continue their battle but if it lands on tails they postpone their battle to help her find a samurai who smells of sunflowers whom she has sought for years She wins the toss and they embark on a series of adventures alongside Fuus questDuring the closing stories the three finally arrive at the town of Ikitsuki with each ending up in conflict with a group of assassins sent by the government to kill the sunflower samurai Fuus father Seizo Kasumi Fuu finds Kasumi having wanted revenge for him abandoning her and her mother but she relents as he is already dying from an illness One of the assassins kills Kasumi before he is defeated by Jin Mugen and Jin then have their duel their swords shattering but choose not to kill each other as they now consider each other friends Fuu learns her father played a part in the Shimabara Rebellion and went away to protect her Fuu also reveals she lied about the coin toss result which briefly annoys Mugen and Jin Recovered from their final fight the three part ways grateful for their shared adventureSetting and themesSeries director Shinichir Watanabe defined the central theme of Samurai Champloo as the portrayal and acceptance around death themes he had previously explored in his science fiction series Macross Plus  and Cowboy Bebop  Another theme outlined in the series pitch was individuality and finding ones unique identity The series is set in Edo period Japan roughly sixty years after the end of the Sengoku period While a historical time period the anime does not focus on historical detail beyond minor inclusions and references mainly using contemporarystyle dialogue and behavior A conscious inclusion was emphasising cultural acceptance and tolerance of minorities including the indigenous Ainu people foreigners LGBT people and Christians the historical Edo period was a time when Japan was highly structured conformist and isolationist Due to its Edo setting and incorporation of samurai culture and honor codes Watanabe was worried the anime would be seen as nationalistic in tone prompting its focus on minorities and tolerance Watanabe put in as much as he could manage of these themes and subjects challenging earlier limitations imposed by a lack of historical information from the time and Japanese television codes restricting the portrayal of Japanese minorities in the periodThe main cultural influence on the anime is the music and associated subculture of hip hop Watanabe had been a fan of hip hop music from his high school years citing his first exposure as The Message by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five He compared the samurai culture to hip hop through a similar philosophy of selfidentity The use of hip hop also reinforced the series focus on its minority and countercultural cast creating a cultural reference by using one with the other Alongside his liking of hip hop Watanabe attributed a large amount of the series inspiration in the works of actor Shintaro Katsu particularly his historical dramas The narrative approach of the finished series was inspired by Katsus notorious habit of directing projects without a set story structure The word Champloo in the title was derived from the Okinawan term chanpur with Watanabe comparing the blending of elements in the anime with the meaning of chanpur The food depicted in the show was originally accurated to the Edo period but eventually expanded to include anachronistic dishes such as okonomiyakiThe plot is structured like a road movie with little connection between stories until the final threepart arc contrasting against the serial structure of its contemporaries Watanabe particularly cited the movies about the blind samurai Zatoichi as an inspiration for this style Other influences on the series included Enter the Dragon and Dirty Harry One episode was based around the Chinese concept of Qi During early planning the series tone was far more serious but after the first four episodes had been written the staff were worried about the tone becoming bleak prompting a greater focus on comedy Several episodes incorporate references homages and parodies of popular media The Japanese episode titles use fourcharacter idioms referencing the theme of that episodes story They drew from multiple sources including Japanese and Western sayings the first episodes title Shippu Doto is a Japanese rendering of the German saying Sturm und Drang philosophical concepts Inga Oho references a proverb about the workings of karma and pieces of classic media the episode title Anya Koro references Naoya Shigas novel of the same name The English episode titles were created by translator Ryan Morris Morris did not directly translate the Japanese titles instead using alliteration to preserve the rhythm and meaningCharactersThe series follows the exploits of the three leadsFuu Mugen and Jinwhen they are drawn together by circumstance and end up traveling together to find the sunflower samurai The main cast was created by Watanabe who wanted a cast of heroes who were silly immature and dangerous with a touch of insanity He described Mugen and Jin as unconventional people not bound by the rules of the period The characters were designed by Kazuto Nakazawa who had worked as both an artist and director on multiple projects including Ashita no Nadja and the anime segments of Kill Bill Volume  The early character drafts were more to Nakazawas tastes than the wishes of the production team resulting in numerous redrafts based on requests The voice recording included sessions with all three leads together which caused occasional tensions due to their different work backgroundsMugen  is a vagrant outlaw from the Ryukyu Islands who uses selftaught sword techniques Having lived a harsh and solitary life since childhood he has a deep mistrust and disdain of authority and lives to fight strong opponents Watanabe thought of Mugen as young and a little stupid putting him in stark contrast with Cowboy Bebop protagonist Spike Spiegel He also described Mugen as symbolizing a rappers ideal of selfexpression Mugens Ryukyuen origins formed part of Watanabes focus on inclusivity and tolerance within the narrative He is voiced in Japanese by Kazuya Nakai His performance changed little from the audition someone on the edge who did not follow rules His performance reportedly improved during the soundchecks which had a more relaxed atmosphere and emphasis on timing In English Mugen is voiced by Steve BlumJin  is Mugens antithesis a calm and stoic ronin wandering Japan after being forced to kill his master and consequently wearing glasses to disguise himself He is the best at sensing danger and prone to risking his life to prove his worth He is a master of mujushinken a style of kenjutsu created in the early Edo period by Harigaya Sekiun Jin was created as a foil for Mugen to stop the story from becoming onedimensional A scrapped idea of Watanabes was for Jin to be an anarchist but otherwise his personality and design changed little during production He is voiced in Japanese by Ginpei Sato at the time a stage actor who had not done voice roles previously after failing auditions for two other projects his failed audition for Wolfs Rain prompted a staff member to recommend him to Watanabe He had to learn about voice acting on the job including timing and getting into character and during recording for later episodes got into trouble due to wanting to shift his portrayal of the character In English Jin is voiced by Kirk ThorntonFuu  is the one who brings Mugen and Jin together to help her She is a cheerful and spirited young woman and a jackofalltrades due to her constant changing between parttime jobs starting the series working as a tea waitress she has a pet flying squirrel called Momo A recurring gag is Fuu temporarily becoming fat after eating a lot Out of the three characters Fuus personality changed the least from Watanabes original series concept though her character design underwent major revisions to become more conventionally beautiful She is voiced in Japanese by Ayako Kawasumi Compared to her other roles Kawasumi was asked not to overact her effort sounds outside scenes where her character was very expressive making her more realistic It was the first time she did not create a separate internal character to voice Fuu being asked to be herself as far as possible Her favorite episode was Stranger Searching when the fat Fuu first appeared as she found voicing this version a challenge In English Fuu is voiced by Kari WahlgrenIn the original plan there were three semiregular characters that would appear through the series They were Rekku a Dutchman claiming to be Japanese Koku a traveling priest acquainted with Jins past and Sara a female ninja who falls in love with Mugen While their roles were reduced to oneoff appearances versions of the characters survived Rekku became the character Joji in Stranger Searching the priest appeared in Lethal Lunacy while Sara was a central character in Elegy of Entrapment An early antagonist is Ryujiro the son of a corrupt government official who loses his arm to Mugen in the opening episode and later plots revenge against them Historical figures or character homages also appear for example painter Hishikawa Moronobu Joji who is a fictionalized version of Isaac Titsingh a version of American baseball player Alexander Cartwright and Ando Uohori who is a direct reference to Andy WarholProductionSamurai Champloo was the debut television production of animation studio Manglobe which was started in  by Sunrise veteran Shinichir Kobayashi The opening animation was contributed to by the studio Madhouse A production committee to support the project was formed by Victor Entertainments Shir Sasaki partnering with Tokuma Shoten and North American company Geneon Entertainment Watanabe acted as the series director in addition to creating the project Kobayashi Sasaki Sanae Mitsugi and Hideki Goto were credited as planners and executive producers and the producers were Takatoshi Hamano Takashi Kochiyama and Tetsuro SatomiThe story was composed by Shinji Obara and Yukihiko Tsutsumi of Office Crescendo with scripts written by Obara Dai Sat Touko Machida Keiko Nobumoto Seiko Takagi Ryota Sugi and Watanabe Nakazawa wrote and storyboarded episode  being credited as Uwadan Shimofuwato in the former role Nakazawa also acted as both character designer and chief animation director The art director was Takeshi Waki the storyboard director was Kazuki Akane and coloring was led by Eri Suzuki Additional characters were created by Hideto Komori Weapon designs were cocreated by Mahiro Maeda and Manglobe managing director Hidero Okamoto The cinematographer was Kazuhiro Yamada with Syuichi Kakesu as lead editor Numerous guest creators were also brought in for different episodes as artists or animation directors including Shk Murase Takeshi Yoshimoto Naoko Nakamoto Hiroyuki Imaishi and Tensai OkamuraConcept and developmentThe concept for Samurai Champloo was created by Watanabe in  then known for his work on Cowboy Bebop He wanted to create a series antithetical to the largely calm and mature atmosphere of Cowboy Bebop wanting a complete change due to fatigue after working on one project for such a long period The success of Cowboy Bebop meant he was permitted to develop whatever he wanted for his next project As with his other projects he drew inspiration from music then matched a narrative to it His approach was combining two of his favorite things classic samurai adventure films and series and hip hop music into a single work He created the concept for Samurai Champloo during this period but work on it was delayed due to his work on Cowboy Bebop The Movie and his segments of The Animatrix at Studio C Kobayashi had invited Wanatabe to work on an original project at Manglobe when it was founded in February  and Watanabe sent the Samurai Champloo pitch in May of that year The pitch included the central concepts for the series and draft designs for the lead characters Watanabe invited Nakazawa on board as he was a fan of his work and wanted the opportunity to work with him Obara known more for his work on liveaction movies and television dramas was brought in through a mutual friend at Office CrescendoThe eventual unstructured production style was unheard of in anime and at the outset Obara created a series structure The threeepisode finale was not planned ahead emerging naturally as part of the design approach As the project evolved Watanabe pushed for this structured approach to be discarded aside from the lead characters and premise and Obara agreed to the new approach The lack of a structure meant that the series narrative was constructed piece by piece with few plot details being decided in advance The fates of the three characters were also undecided during this stage Watanabe originally planned for all three to survive but at one point the team considered Jin and Mugen dying respectively in the final two episodes Even the identity of the sunflower samurai was unknown to Watanabe during the early stages Due to this approach preproduction on the series lasted a year Watanabe had a great deal of creative control and input including on music selection and editingThe first episode took a long time to polish being completed around the beginning of  but it and subsequent episodes had an animation quality higher than other series of the time This was attributed to the working environment of Manglobe allowing for easy communication between staff members and Watanabes passion for the project prompting famous staff from other notable anime projects to come on board The nonstandard style of production left some members of staff including Sasaki skeptical that the series would be finished For the sound mixing Watanabe wanted the same approach and quality as Cowboy Bebop The Movie bringing in sound engineer Masashi Yabuhara who had worked with Yoko Kanno on the sound design of Cowboy Bebop The fight scenes were choreographed to appear more realistic than other period dramas which featured a clashing of swords which in reality would chip them Unique eyecatch artwork was created for each episode based on its themes and content Woodblock prints portraying the characters designed by former shojo manga creator Tsubaki Anna were shown at various points through the series Nakazawa created the illustration use for sponsor announcementsScenario and art designSamurai Champloo was Obaras first time working on an anime series and Watanabe attributed him with bringing a new style of narrative and pacing to the series Sato had worked with Watanabe before on Macross Plus He described the process of discussing plot concepts with Watanabe and building upon voiced ideas treating his own contributions like sample discs that might be accepted or rejected The script meetings were unusually long beginning with the synopsis and ending up with the final form alongside offtopic conversation that was sometimes incorporated into that episodes plot Due to Watanabes reputation and the success of his projects in the West the anime was created with a Western audience in mind with the expectation that it would be more successful outside Japan This resulted in more overt references to Western culture being included An assassin character who appeared in the second episode was intended to appear during the finale but he was cut due to time constraints and a general lack of people remembering his earlier appearanceNakazawa had trouble getting a feel for the characters with Mugens design still going through adjustments when production on the first episode began For the animation of Mugens fighting style the team used gymnastic footage as a reference alongside incorporating breakdancing moves For Jin Nakazawa ignored all of the conventions for sword fighting and kept his fighting style inconsistent throughout the series basing his reactions and tactics on combat sports He broke animation conventions to make these techniques work confusing the animation team For his work as art director after joining during production of the first episode Waki was instructed to create extremes of light and darkness in scenes creating a realistic impression of the period when artificial light sources were scarce and expensive The variety and more contemporary elements prevented Waki from growing bored with the Edo setting The approach to the animation lacking an overarching plan was described as a reflection of the lead characters nonconformist personalitiesNakazawa designed the mens kimono to resemble contemporary jackets incorporating homages to sports designs such as Adidas and Puma Many secondary characters were designed based on both the series voice actors and staff members During the production of the second half of the series it became increasingly difficult for Nakazawa to design all guest characters resulting in Komori being brought in Due to most of these characters being older men when the early plan was for a young cast with several female characters Komori felt disappointed by his workload Maeda was brought on for weapon designs when the plan was to have strong antagonists with unique weapons for each episode but the plan never came about and when Maeda moved to working on Gankutsuou The Count of Monte Cristo the design work shifted to Okamoto The incorporation of graffiti was suggested by Sato to further enhance the hip hop aesthetic and tone He also suggested the inclusion of references to Warhol and JeanMichel BasquiatMusicThe music for Samurai Champloo was collaboratively composed by Shinji Tsutchie Tsuchida of Shakkazombie Fat Jon Nujabes and Force of Nature All were artists from the hip hop music genre with Tsutchie being a friend of Watanabe A number of guest artists contributed to different episodes The opening theme Battlecry was composed by Nujabes with Shing singing and writing the lyrics The ending themes were created by Minmi Kazami and Azuma Riki The final episodes ending theme was San Francisco licensed from the rapper band MidicronicaThe Music of Samurai Champloo was released across four CDs during  by Victor Entertainment under their JVC label The first two Masta and

Weekly was concerned about the opening episodes similarity to the setup for Cowboy Bebop In a similar review for Play Magazine Dave Halverson noted his enjoyment of the story but felt readers should see the anime with as little story information as possible DVDTalks Todd Douglass noted the simple premise of the story but enjoyed each episodes plot and praised the interactions of the main cast and its sense of style Nick Browne of THEM Anime was less positive faulting its weaker multiepisode stories and uneven treatment of serious cultural issues despite enjoying the humor born from its main cast Salvan Bonaminio of The Escapist described the main cast as stereotypes faulted the forgettable supporting cast and called many episodes including the ending underwhelming James Beckett of Anime News Network enjoyed the main cast but negatively cited a lack of cohesion across the series and strongly criticised Fuus frequent kidnappings for story purposes as detrimental to her characterHalverson gave praise to the animation and character designs without specific commentary while Robinson positively compared the fight choreography and art design to Watanabes work on Cowboy Bebop and The Animatrix Douglass cited the anime as a perfect example of Watanabes visual style and Browne cited its visuals and technical achievements as high points Bonaminio included a positive mention of the animes visible production quality during his summary Becket felt the animation style had aged poorly though giving praise to the art style and fight sequences The music met with general praise for its use and style Becket additionally praised the English dubThe mixture of traditional elements with hip hop met with some mixed responses Halverson was enthusiastic about them and called the hip hop representation superior to many Western portrayals Robinson also enjoyed them noting that they kept the anime from being too much like Cowboy Bebop Browne enjoyed the contemporary visual references used alongside the Edo setting but faulted the shows reliance on them By contrast Bonaminio cited its sense of style and unique blend of elements its greatest strengthAs part of a
