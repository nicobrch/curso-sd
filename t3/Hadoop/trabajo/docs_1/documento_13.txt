Christian mystical traditions including Midrashic tales and Kabbalah The psychoanalytic accounts of human behavior put forward by Freud and Jung are also prominently featuredNeon Genesis Evangelion

Evangelion retelling the events of the series with different plot elements and a new ending were released between  and  Film manga home video and other products in the Evangelion franchise have

years after a global cataclysm called the Second Impact teenager Shinji Ikari is summoned to the futuristic city of Tokyo by his estranged father Gendo Ikari who is the director of the special paramilitary force Nerv Shinji witnesses United Nations forces battling an Angel one of a race of monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold in the Dead Sea Scrolls Because of the Angels nearimpenetrable forcefields Nervs Evangelion biomachines which are synchronized to their pilots nervous systems and possess their own forcefields are the only weapons capable of fighting the Angels Nerv officer Misato Katsuragi escorts Shinji into the Nerv complex beneath Tokyo where Gendo pressures him into piloting Evangelion Unit against the Angel Without training Shinji is quickly overwhelmed causing the Evangelion to go berserk and savagely kill the Angel on its ownFollowing hospitalization Shinji moves in with Misato and settles into life in Tokyo In his second battle Shinji defeats an Angel but runs away afterward distraught Misato confronts Shinji and he decides to remain a pilot Shinji and Nervs crew must defeat the remaining fourteen Angels to prevent the Third Impact a global cataclysm that would destroy the world Evangelion Unit is repaired shortly afterward and Shinji tries to befriend its pilot Rei Ayanami a mysterious and socially isolated teenage girl With Reis help Shinji defeats another Angel They are joined by Evangelion Units pilot the multitalented but insufferable teenager Asuka Langley Sryu who is GermanJapaneseAmerican The three of them manage to defeat several Angels and as Shinji adjusts to his new role as a pilot he gradually becomes more confident and selfassured Asuka moves in with Shinji and they begin to develop confusing feelings for one another kissing at her provocationAfter being absorbed by an Angel Shinji breaks free thanks to Eva acting on its own He is later forced to fight Evangelion Unit who has become infected and its pilot his friend and classmate Toji Suzuhara becomes incapacitated and permanently disabled Asuka loses her selfconfidence following a defeat and spirals into depression which is worsened by her next fight against an Angel who attacks her mind It forces her to relive her worst fears and childhood trauma resulting in a mental breakdown In the next battle Rei sacrifices herself to selfdestruct Unit and save Shinjis life Misato and Shinji visit the hospital where they find Rei alive but claiming she is the third Rei Misato forces the scientist Ritsuko Akagi to reveal the dark secrets of Nerv the Evangelion boneyard and the Dummy Plug system which operates using clones of Rei who was created using the DNA of Shinjis mother Yui Ikari This succession of events leaves Shinji emotionally scarred and alienated from the rest of the characters Kaworu Nagisa replaces the catatonic Asuka as Units pilot and befriends Shinji gaining his trust He is revealed to be the final foretold Angel Tabris and fights Shinji realizing that he must die to allow humanity to survive He asks Shinji to kill him and he hesitates but eventually kills Kaworu an event that causes him to be overridden with guiltAfter the final Angel is defeated Gendo triggers the Human Instrumentality Project a forced evolution of humanity in which the souls of mankind are merged for benevolent purposes He believes that if unified humanity could overcome the loneliness and alienation that has eternally plagued them Shinjis soul grapples with the reason for his existence and reaches an epiphany that he needs others to thrive enabling him to destroy the wall of negative emotions that torment him and reunite with the others who congratulate himCharactersHideaki Anno attempted to create characters that reflected parts of his own personality The characters of Evangelion struggle with their interpersonal relationships their personal problems and traumatic events in their past The human qualities of the characters have enabled some viewers of the show to identify with the characters on a personal level while others interpret them as historical religious or philosophical symbolsShinji Ikari is the series protagonist and the designated pilot of Evangelion Unit After witnessing his mother Yui Ikaris death as a child Shinji is abandoned by his father Gendo Ikari He is emotionally hypersensitive and sometimes does as expected out of fear of rejection but he has often rebelled and refused to pilot the Eva because of the excruciating harm that has been done to him or to his friends Throughout the series he says to himself I mustnt run away as a means of encouraging himself to face the threats of the day and this sometimes actually gives him bravery in battle but he has a lingering habit of withdrawing in response to traumatic events Anno has described Shinji as a boy who shrinks from human contact and has convinced himself that he is a completely unnecessary personThe withdrawn and mysterious pilot of Evangelion Unit Rei Ayanami is a clone made from the salvaged remains of Yui and is plagued by a sense of negative selfworth stemming from the realization that she is an expendable asset She at first despises Shinji for his lack of trust in his father Gendo with whom Rei is very close However after Shinji and Rei successfully defeat the Angel Ramiel she takes a friendly liking to him Towards the end of the series it is revealed that she is one of many clones whose use is to replace the currently existing Rei if she is killedAsuka Langley Soryu is a child prodigy who pilots Evangelion Unit and possesses a fiery temper and an overabundance of pride and selfconfidence which often gets her in trouble and difficulty especially during battles As a little girl Asuka discovered the body of her mother shortly after she committed suicide leading the child to repress her emotions and vow never to cry Asuka and Shinji develop intense but ambiguous feelings toward each other and have difficulty reaching out to others Their relationship was initially modeled on the one between Jean Nadias love interest and eventual husband in the earlier Nadia Similarly to Shinji Asuka and Rei are presented with their own flaws and difficulty relating to other peopleMisato Katsuragi is the caretaker and commanding officer for Shinji and Asuka Her professional demeanor at Nerv contrasts dramatically with her carefree and irresponsible behavior at home Character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto conceived her as an older girl next door and promiscuous loser who failed to take life seriously Hideaki Anno described Shinji and Misato as afraid of being hurt and unsuitablelacking the positive attitudefor what people call heroes of an adventureThe teenage Evangelion pilots are ordered into battle by the steely Gendo Ikari Shinjis father and the commander of Nerv He abandoned Shinji and recalled him only to serve as an Evangelion pilot Gendo salvaged the remains of his dead wifes body to create Rei whom he viewed as a mere tool at his disposal to defeat the Angels and enact Instrumentality Similar to Shinji he is somewhat asocial and is afraid of being insulted by others and often runs away from such often committing immoralities in the process This fear is also what drove him to abandon Shinji He is depicted as relentless in his drive to win a man who takes drastic and extreme measures by fair means or foul or by hook or by crook in order to accomplish his own purpose According to Yoshiyuki Sadamoto the characters of Gendo and Fuyutsuki are based on Ed Straker and Alec Freeman of the television series UFO Sadamoto designed the visual appearance of the characters so that their personalities could be understood more or less at a glance The distinctive aesthetic appeal of the female lead characters designs contributed to the high sales of Neon Genesis Evangelion merchandise The design of Rei in particular became so popular that the media referred to the character as Premium Girl due to the high sales of books with Rei on the coverProductionDirector Hideaki Anno fell into a depression following the completion of work on Nadia The Secret of Blue Water and the  failure of the Royal Space Force The Wings of Honnamise sequel project Blue Uru According to Yasuhiro Takeda after the failure of Blue Uru Anno agreed to a collaboration between King Records and Gainax while drinking with King representative Toshimichi tsuki King Records guaranteed Anno a time slot for something anything Anno began the development of the new series in  around the notion of not running away which had been the underlying theme of Aoki Uru which focused on a protagonist accustomed to avoiding personal responsibility who finds himself trying to save the heroine of the story Early into the production he stated his intent to have Evangelion increase the number of anime fans named otaku in Japanese and attract interest in the anime medium bringing a breath of fresh air to the mecha genre In the early design phase of the Evangelion project several formats were considered including a film a television series and an original video animation OVA series The producers finally opted for the television series as it was the most widely accessible media in Japan at that time Anno also originally proposed the title Alcion for the new series but this was rejected due to its lack of hard consonant sounds He conceived the series as a metaphor of his fouryear depression as he tried to put his whole self into the work and imprint his own feelings on the filmCritics noted how Evangelion borrowed certain scenarios and the use of introspection as a narrative device from a previous Anno project entitled Gunbuster He also incorporated the narrative structure of Nadia and multiple frames of reference leaving the story open to interpretation The production was complex and saw several changes to the scenario initially imagined by Gainax A female protagonist was initially proposed for the series but the idea was scrapped In the first scenario the first episode presented the battle between an Angel and Rei while the character of Shinji was only introduced after the Angel had been temporarily defeated Further changes to the plot were made following the Aum Shinrikyo sects sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March Azuma Hiroki has said that the original Evangelion story was too close to reality from Annos point of view Anno thought that the original scenario was not suitable for broadcasting and he feared censorship However he also criticized Aum Shinrikyo because they lost any contact with reality For this reason Azuma stated that Evangelion is an intrinsic critique of AumThe final version of the story reflects inspiration drawn from numerous other anime and fictional works Chief among these are Space Battleship Yamato Mobile Suit Gundam Devilman and Space Runaway Ideon The series also incorporates tributes to Childhoods End the novels of Ry Murakami The Andromeda Strain The Divine Invasion the poem Pippa Passes The Hitcher and several television series including The Prisoner Thunderbirds Ultraman and Ultra SevenThe development of the Neon Genesis Evangelion series ran close to deadlines throughout its production run The initial cuts of the first two episodes were screened at the second Gainax festival in July  only three months before they were aired on television By the thirteenth episode the series began to deviate significantly from the original story and the initial project was abandoned The number of Angels was reduced to seventeen instead of the original twentyeight the writers also changed the storys ending which had originally described the failure of the Human Instrumentality Project after an Angel attack from the Moon Not only did the series suffer from scheduling issues but according to Anno despite Gainax being the lead studio for the series the company itself had inadequate materials and staff for the full production of the series Only three staff members from Gainax were working on the series at any given time and the majority of the series production was outsourced to Tatsunoko ProductionStarting with the sixteenth episode the show changed drastically discarding the grand narrative concerning salvation for a narrative focusing on the individual characters This change coincided with Annos development of an interest in psychology after a friend lent him a book on mental illness This focus culminated in a psychoanalysis of the characters in the two final episodes Necessity forced Anno to abandon the script of the twentyfifth episode to work with a new one These episodes feature heavy use of abstract animation flashbacks simple line drawings photographs and fixed image scenes with voiceover dialogue Some critics speculated that these unconventional animation choices resulted from budget cuts but Toshio Okada stated that it wasnt only a problem of schedule or budget since Anno couldnt decide the ending until the time came Thats his style These two episodes sparked controversy and condemnation among fans and critics of the series In  Hideaki Anno and Gainax released two animated feature films providing another ending for the show named Death  Rebirth and The End of EvangelionThemesReferences to mystical traditions in Judaism and Christianity including Midrashic literature and Kabbalah are threaded liberally through the series Complicating viewers attempts to form an unambiguous interpretation the series reworks Midrash stories Zohar images and other Kabbalistic ideas developed from the Book of Genesis to create a new Evangelionspecific mythology The plot also combines elements of esotericism and mysticism of the Jewish Kabbalah including the Angels which have common and individual features with the Angels of the religious tradition such as Sachiel Sandalphon and Ramiel Assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki stated the religious visual references were intended to make the series more interesting and exotic for a Japanese audience denying the existence of a religious meaning for the use of Christian visual symbols in the show According to Anno as the symbols are mixed together for the first time something like an interrelationship or a meaning emergesAccording to Patrick Drazen numerous allusions to the Kojiki and the Nihongi have a prominent role in Evangelion along with the Shinto vision of the primordial cosmos and the mythical lances of the Shinto deities Izanagi and Izanami Elements of the JudeoChristian tradition also feature prominently throughout the series including references to Adam Lilith Eve the Lance of Longinus the Dead Sea Scrolls the Kabbalistic concept of Adam Kadmon and the Tree of Life The merging of all human souls into one through the Human Instrumentality Project at the end of the series has been compared to the Kabbalistic concept of tikkun olam The Evangelions have been likened to the golem of Jewish folklore and their visual design resembles the traditional depictions of oni Japanese demons or ogresNeon Genesis Evangelion has been interpreted as a deeply personal expression of Hideaki Annos own emotional struggles with depression During the production of the series he became interested in mental illness and psychology According to him Rei is a schizophrenic character and a representation of Shinjis unconscious while Shinji has an Oedipus complex and is characterized by a libidodestrudo conflict Similarly Ritsuko has an Electra complex in which she loves Gendo a sort of substitute for her father figure Anno himself stated that he identifies with Shinji in both a conscious and unconscious manner while Rei is Annos deepest part and Kaworu his Jungian shadow Shinjis entering into Unit has been interpreted as a Freudian return to the womb and his struggle to be free of the Eva as his rite of passage into manhood The series also contains references to philosophical and psychoanalytic concepts such as the oral stage introjection oral personality ambivalence and the death drive including elements of the works of Sigmund Freud Arthur Schopenhauer and Sren KierkegaardRelated mediaFilmsIn May  Gainax announced an Evangelion film in response to fan dissatisfaction with the series finale On March   Gainax released Neon Genesis Evangelion Death  Rebirth

consensus reads Neon Genesis Evangelion both a cultural touchstone for Japan and an uncompromising auteurist vision by creator Hideaki Anno doubles as an enthralling apex for the mecha anime genre and as a harrowing exploration of depression  making for a wholly singular epic about angels and inner demonsThe richness of the characters and complex and layered narrative has received praise by critics In  Max Autohead of Hyper rated it  out of  praising the brilliant and fantastic storyline with amazing characters who pull you not only into their world but into their psyche as well The same year

detailFollowing the conclusion of the series original television broadcast the public and critical reception to Neon Genesis Evangelion was polarized particularly with regard to the final two episodes The experimental style of the finale confused or alienated many fans and spawned debate and controversy the criticism was largely directed toward the lack of storyline resolution in the final two episodes Opinion on the finale was mixed with the audience broadly divided between those who considered the episodes deep and those who felt their meaning was more apparent than real The English voice actors admitted that they also had trouble understanding the series conclusion The Mainichi Times wrote that broadcast of the penultimate episode nearly all viewers felt betrayed  When commentator Eiji tsuka sent a letter to the Yomiuri Shimbun complaining about the end of the Evangelion series the debate went nationwide Despite the criticism Anno stood by his artistic choices for the series

the subject of numerous media reports debates and research studies worldwide The show has received review by critics academics and sociologists alike including by Susan J Napier William Rout Mick Broderick Mari Kotani Shinji Miyadai Hiroki Azuma Yuriko Furuhata and Marc Steinberg The series has been described as both a critique and deconstruction of the mecha genre Japanese critic Manabu Tsuribe considered that Evangelion was extremely interior and is lacking in sociality so that it seems to reflect pathology of the times Anime News Networks Martin Theron described the character design as distinctive designed to be sexy rather than cutesy and the mecha designs as among the most distinctive ever produced for an anime series with sleek lithe appearances that look monstrous fearsome and nimble rather than boxy and knightlike Mike Crandol stated It no longer seems contrite to say that Evangelion is surely one of the alltime great works of animation In February

legacyEvangelion has had a significant impact on Japanese popular culture The series also had a strong influence on anime at a time when the anime industry and televised anime series were in a slump period CNET reviewer Tim Hornyak credits the series with revitalizing and transforming the giant mecha genre In the s and s Japanese animation saw decreased production following the economic crash in Japan This was followed by a crisis of ideas in the years to come Against this background Evangelion imposed new standards for the animated serial ushering in the era of the new Japanese animation serial characterized by innovations that allowed a technical and artistic revival of the industry The production of anime serials began to reflect greater author control the concentration of resources in fewer but higher quality episodes typically ranging from thirteen to twentysix a directorial approach similar to live film and greater freedom from the constraints of merchandisingAccording to TV Tokyos Keisuke Iwata the global spread of Japanese animation dramatically expanded due to the popularity of Evangelion In Japan Evangelion prompted a review of the cultural value of anime and its success according to Roland Kelts made the medium more accessible to the international youth scene With the interest in the series otaku culture became a mass social phenomenon The shows regular reruns increased the number of otaku while John Lynden links its popularity to a boom in interest in literature on the Dead Sea Scrolls Kabbalah and ChristianityCritics traced Evangelions influence on subsequent anime series including Serial Experiments Lain RahXephon Texhnolyze Gasaraki Guilty Crown Boogiepop Phantom Blue Submarine No  Mobile Battleship Nadesico Rinne no Lagrange Gurren Lagann Dual Parallel Trouble Adventure Argento Soma Pilot Candidate Generator Gawl and DaiGuard References homages and tributes to the series are also contained in Japanese and Western media such as the third episode of Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi Koi Koi Seven Hayate the Combat Butler Baka and Test Regular Show My Little Pony Friendship is Magic Gravity Falls Sgt Frog Rick and Morty One Hour Photo Steven Universe Kong Skull Island and Nope The shows mixture of religion and mecha also influenced subsequent Japanese video games including Xenogears and El Shaddai Ascension of the MetatronThe design and personality traits of the character Rei Ayanami were reused for many anime and manga characters of the late s such as Ruri Hoshino of Nadesico Ruriko Tsukushima The Droplet Miharu Gasaraki Anthy Himemiya Revolutionary Girl Utena and Lain Iwakura Serial Experiments Lain The character of Asuka was parodied by Excel Excel Saga and some of her traits were used to create the character of Mai in Gunparade March According to Italian critic Guido Tavassi Evangelions mecha design characterized by a greater resemblance to the human figure and the abstract designs of the Angels also had a significant impact on the designs of future anime productions Nobuhiro Watsuki designed several characters for Rurouni Kenshin based on characters from Neon Genesis Evangelion namely Uonuma Usui Honj Kamatari and Fuji Other artists have cited the series as an inspiration including Makoto Shinkai and Gege Akutami for their manga Jujutsu Kaisen In the aftermath of Evangelion Anno reused stylistic conceits from the series in the liveaction Love  Pop and the anime romance Kare Kano Neon Genesis Evangelion also influenced music artists such as the British band Fightstar and its debut album Grand Unification and the Japanese band Rey which derived its name from the character of Rei AyanamiMerchandisingThe popularity of Neon Genesis Evangelion extends to its merchandising which exceeded  million within two years of its release The series has established itself greatly on the Japanese market developing a varied range of products for adult consumers such as cell phones laptop computers many soundtracks DVDs action figures telephone cards and an official set of Japanese coins The stylized mecha design that would later earn praise for Evangelion was initially criticized by certain toy companies as being too difficult to manufacture with some expressing concern that models of the Evangelion mecha would never sell Eventually Sega agreed to license all toy and video game sales At the time of the release of the Japanese film Death  Rebirth and The End of Evangelion estimated sales of Evangelion merchandise topped  million of which  derived from sales of video and laser discs soundtrack CDs single CDs computer software and the threevolume manga Multiple merchandising products were released during the Renewal Project such as CDs video games celart illustrations and collectible modelsThe commercial exploitation of the series for the home video market achieved record sales and remained strong over a decade later The fame of the show has grown through home video sales which exceeded two or three times the sales of other contemporary anime series and films According to anime critic Guido Tavassi the series contributed significantly to the spread of the DVD format in Japan and generated a considerable impact on the Japanese economy calculated in billions of yen In  Matt Greenfield stated that the franchise had earned over  billion A  estimate placed total sales of  related goods at over  billion By  more than two million Evangelion pachinko and pachislot machines had been sold generating  billion in revenueReferencesCitationsBibliographyFurther
