violence and dark humor Tatsuki Fujimoto always wanted to serialize in Weekly Shnen Jump but he had the feeling that his work would be buried if he had made a Jumplike manga so he tried to retain much of his individuality as a creator while making only the structure and characters Jumplike Fujimoto also said that despite its success in the magazine he wanted to write the second part of the series on Shnen Jump because he wanted to do a completely different series from the first part According to him there is not much of a difference in working between Weekly Shnen Jump and Shnen Jump explaining that there were a few depictions that got stopped during the rough draft stage but he was allowed to do anything he wanted regarding the logic of the storyFujimoto said that he took inspiration from various works During the serialization of Chainsaw Man Fujimoto said that he was too busy but he watched as many new things as he could and borrowed various elements from what he saw On Twitter he stated that he was a fan of the  film trilogy Kizumonogatari and that the trilogys final battle shown in Part  Reiketsu inspired the final battle of the first part of Chainsaw Man He also described the series as a wicked FLCL and a pop Abara Fujimoto had various elements from the series planned from the beginning while other things were added as it progressed He did not have specific plans to bring payoff to the meaningfulsounding words and things that felt off adding that he left various things vague to make the series second part easier to doRegarding the anime adaptation of the series Fujimoto stated that he talked to the people handling it and he was comfortable leaving things to them When the anime series was officially announced Fujimoto commented Chainsaw Man is like a copycat of Dorohedoro and Jujutsu Kaisen and the studio of Dorohedoro and Jujutsu Kaisen will produce its anime I have nothing to say Please do it According to the mangas editor

continued to be in close contact with MAPPAs anime team MAPPA producer Makoto Kimura also commented that Fujimoto involvement extended to the casting planning and music because the staff wanted the

critics James Beckett of Anime News Network ranked the first volume as a B Beckett commented Chainsaw Man is goofy kinky dark and bizarre which is already the kind of tonal mishmash Im generally down for in my art praising as well its compelling worldbuilding and character development adding that the volume earns plenty of goodwill by committing to its surprisingly earnest and charming brand of ferocious bloodletting Nicholas Dupree from the same website commented its a bizarre unpredictable and undeniably unique thrill ride and love it or hate it theres nothing else quite like it Hannah Collins of Comic Book Resources gave the series a positive review stating Chainsaw Man bears all the hallmarks of a standard supernatural action series but its quieter moments are where its dark heart beats fastest Polygons Julia Lee gave the series a positive review commenting Chainsaw Man is considered one of Shonen Jumps best new series and for good reason The graphic ripandtear fights paired with a unique and funny story about devils makes for one great manga Sheena McNeil of Sequential Tart gave the first volume a  McNeil stated I did not think I was going to enjoy this manga Im glad I was wrong She noted that the series has similar elements from Army of Darkness Devilman Dorohedoro and inspiration from various devilhunting series recommending it to fans of those worksAnna Neatrour of Manga Report gave a positive review to the first volume calling its monster fighting buckets of gore and humor plenty amusing and calling Denji an incredibly damaged but potentially powerful hero Reviewing the first volume Danica Davidson of Otaku USA called the series a little creepy and downright bizarre adding however that it is a bloody actionpacked shonen with some heart showing through the weirdness and its been very successful in Japan Following her readathoning of the series Katherine Dacey of The Manga Critic commented that she finished it with a grudging respect for Fujimotos excessive ridiculous creation which entertained and repelled me in equal measure Your mileage will vary Ian Wolf of Anime UK News gave the first volume a  Wolf wrote that the main feature of the series is the action sequences but criticized the lack of depth in writing concluding Chainsaw Man has some things going for it and hopefully may well build up from a promising startFujimotos art style has also been commended Collins praised Fujimotos penmanship stating that the thicklysketched lines on individual characters and still moments convey the rough edges of its world Dupree lauded the series art style stating as the Devil enemies of the story grow more powerful his imagination for bizarre abstract and genuinely unsettling visual storytelling reaches heights Ive never seen in a Jump series before Beckett called the character designs and general linework a bit generic at first glance but that when the carnage comes flooding in the series has a clarity of style and consistency of vision that can be wondrous to behold McNeil said that the character designs other than Pochita and Chainsaw Man are not memorable but that the art really shines for the creepy Devils the action and especially the gore Regarding the devils designs Dacey wrote that some are uninspired and that the most memorable ones are clearly designed to elicit an appreciative ewww Wolf stated that the art of the series feels better than its writing adding that visually the action and fighting make the manga appealingThemesVarious reviewers have commented on the use of violence and gory scenes within the context of the story Dupree wrote that the irreverent tone and deliciously gory violence are elements that make the series really stand out from the getgo Collins wrote that the gory scenes instead of being gratuitous make the story feel refreshingly unfiltered McNeil commented that the series is wonderfully absurd Its funny gorey sic and violent but also has an interesting bit of humanity at its core Davinson called it casually gruesome and violent but that it fits with its theme Lee wrote Chainsaw Man is gory Extremely gory adding that these scenes make the series different from other shnen series calling them pretty gross but fitting for a dark manga about slashing devils down with a chainsaw Dacey called the series a bloodandtestosteronesoaked battle manga commenting that its main appeal is the outrageous displays of gore and violence adding as well that Fujimoto does his utmost to push the boundaries of good taste Beckett wrote that the delightfully ridiculous and bloody premise runs with it in all sorts of fascinating directions adding however that its reveling in crude humor and violence could be offputting to some readersRegarding the characters Adi Tantimedh of Bleeding Cool called them sad broken people who live outside the norms of society and havent learned basic social skills adding as well that the series subtext is about people getting abused degraded dehumanized objectified literally becoming objects He concluded society is to blame for degrading people into tools and objects these mangas sic seem to be saying though they never outright blame Capitalism or the alienating repressiveness of Japanese society The result is one of the more unique manga out there Collins commented that the series has a premise loosely comparable to Jujutsu Kaisen adding however that Denji might fit the mold of a shnen protagonist on paper but that the mold is only there to be broken comparing his life on the fringes of society to a Dickensian parable about the plight of the working class Dacey called Denji a more honest shonen hero than the typical Jump lead he thinks and acts like a real teenage boy right down to his selfabsorption and total objectification of women adding that she could not say she ever warmed to Denji as a lead character Lee commented that the series has an interestingly goofy contrast between the characters and whats going on adding that Denjis simple mind and kindofhorny instincts can get tiring at times but it does not make the series bad and with the introduction of the extremely interesting side characters like Power and Makima the story takes a turn for the betterIts way of handling comedy has also been commented Tantimedh stated that the series has a unique sense of deadpan comic timing that makes the series unique adding as well that the series distinguishes itself for its slapstick comedy and that a deadly earnest tone might have made the series unreadable Beckett said that when he read the premise he took the series at face value as a goofy nonsense comic a parody of shonen manga that primarily exists to push out pageafterpage of grossout gags and gory action also calling it a mishmash of raunchy teen sex comedies Hellboy and The Evil Dead Dupree stated that the crass crude and purposefully lowbrow humor is one of its defining characteristics adding that there are multiple jokes where it feels like half the punchline is that the series in all its gleefully nihilistic indulgence was published in the same magazine as other bleedingly sincere and familyfriendly titles like One Piece or My Hero Academia Neatrour said theres a level of offkilter humor in Chainsaw Man that I find endearing and that it also has plenty of juvenile humor Davinson commented that the humor of the series mainly revolves around Denji trying to get a girlfriend Wolf wrote that the ridiculousness of the story helps to add comedy to the whole thing although he called the humor rather base at bestReviewers have also commented the emotional aspects of the series Dacey discussed its unexpected moments of genuine pathos talking about the interactions between Denji and Pochita noting as well parallels to Denjis relationship with Makima Davidson also stated that the emotional part of the story is about the love between Denji and Pochita Dupree wrote that the series bombastic borderline nihilistic maelstrom of gore and dick jokes is in part a reaction to the absurd and illogical world it takes place in adding that the series has a proudly beating heart Perhaps a cynical heart but one that nonetheless sympathizes with the struggle to find meaning or solace in a cruel and unpredictable world Reviewing the series th and last chapter published in Weekly Shnen Jump Reiichi Narima of Real Sound commented that Denjis growth through loss is a storytelling more related to seinen manga than shnen manga adding that he was deeply moved by the inclusion of this kind of stories in the magazine ultimately calling it a masterpiece and concluding at the core of bloody violence there was a boys sad love storyAwards and nominationsAnimeCritical responseOn review aggregator Rotten
