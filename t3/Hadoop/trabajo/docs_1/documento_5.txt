text message Most phone calls or text messages do not require a response though there are certain points in the game where the player is required to take action Depending on the players choices of how to respond to these phone calls and text messages the plot will progress in a specific directionSynopsisSetting and themesSteinsGate is set in the summer of  approximately one year after the events

alive and well and discovering the message he had sent to Itaru had arrived a week before he sent it Rintaro soon deduces that the PhoneWave he and his friends had been developing is in fact a time machine capable of sending text messages to the past He and his friends soon learn that SERN an organization that has been researching time travel for some time has actually succeeded in sending humans into the past although they seem to have all resulted in the test subjects deaths Rintaro begins experimenting with DMails D D mru short for DeLorean mail which begin to cause major differences in the timeline Kurisu also manages to create a device to send a persons memories through the microwave allowing that person to effectively leap into the pastHowever SERN learns of the time machine and sends a group led by Moeka to retrieve it killing Mayuri in the process Using Kurisus time leap machine Rintaro travels back in time numerous times to try to save Mayuri but to no avail As Rintaro reaches wits end he is approached by Amane Suzuha a girl from a future ruled by SERN due to their possession of a time machine who tells him that he needs to return to a Beta worldline in which Mayuri wont die By undoing the effects of the DMails that caused shifts in the timeline Rintaro regains possession of an IBN  PC that they lost earlier allowing them to crack into SERNs systems and delete the evidence of Rintaros original DMail However Rintaro realizes that by doing so he would have to return to a world line in which Kurisu is dead After realizing their feelings for each other Kurisu tells Rintaro to save Mayuri Reluctantly Rintaro agrees and deletes the evidence of his DMail from SERNs database returning him to the Beta world line where Kurisu died as she did at the start of the story and the rest of the cast sans Rintaro do not remember that anything had happenedA couple days later an alternate world line variant of Suzuha appears before Rintaro having arrived in a time machine from the future She tells Rintaro that the only way to prevent World War III in the future is to prevent Kurisus death at the hands of her father Dr Nakabachi who stole her time travel theory to publish it under his own name However this operation ends in a disaster as Rintaro ends up killing Kurisu himself by mistake After this failure Rintaro receives a message from his future self telling him that the way to save Kurisu without altering the events that led to him developing a time machine is to fool his past self into believing Kurisu had been killed and thus achieving the final divergence value of  which he dubs Steins Gate Returning to the past again Rintaro puts his own life in danger in order to save Kurisus life prevent Nakabachi from successfully escaping with the time travel theory and fool his past self setting him on his journey through time After this Rintaro returns to the Steins Gate world line safe from the threat of a third world war Later Rintaro and Kurisu manage to reunite by chance or by fate in the streets of Akihabara with Kurisu appearing to possess some lingering memories of their history togetherAlternate endingsThe players choices throughout the game may result in alternate endingsIn the Amane Suzuha Ending Okabe decides to not send the DMail that would prevent him from pursuing Suzuha To prevent Mayuris death he relives the final two days before her murder through constant timeleaping After countless leaps Okabe loses all emotion and personality due to reliving the same two days for all eternity Eventually Suzuha notices Okabes behavior She tells him that he will slowly die on the inside and the worlds set divergence will continue as planned Both of them decide to travel to the past together and vow to stop SERNs dystopian future despite the possibility of both losing their memories on arrivalIn the Faris NyanNyan Ending Okabe decides to not send the DMail that results in the death of Fariss father to try to stop the loss of the IBN  computer He instead sends a different DMail in an attempt to convince Fariss father to not part with the IBN computer Beyond  divergence is achieved but the divergence meter gives a strange output and none of Okabes friends have any memories of him In this worldline Okabe and Faris are a couple and live together participating in RaiNet Access Battlers card game tournaments Although disappointed that none of his friends remember him Okabe is still satisfied that he was able to prevent Mayuris death He decides to build a new life with Faris at his sideIn the Urushibara Ruka Ending Okabe decides to not send the DMail that reverts Ruka to a guy He fully accepts Mayuris expected death and makes no more attempts to save her and they spend the last two days together before she dies of a heart attack Okabe and Ruka decide to spend the rest of their lives together both of them sharing a pang of guilt and sadness that only they would understand In a postcredit scene they are revealed to now have a child togetherIn the Shiina Mayuri Ending Okabe must choose between saving Mayuri or Kurisu Realizing that he harbors romantic feelings for Mayuri Okabe and Kurisu decide to return to the Beta worldline in which Kurisus murder continues as planned After hacking into SERNs database with the IBN computer a  divergence is achieved Okabe vows to remember his memories of Kurisu and spends his time with Mayuri as loversThe Makise Kurisu Ending follows a similar route to the True End To achieve this ending one must have had several conversations with Kurisu throughout the game Doing so allows Okabe and Kurisu to realize their inner feelings for each other Unlike the True End Kurisus death is not prevented after the credits Suzuha never returns and it is implied that this world will eventually meet the fate of World War IIIProductionDevelopmentSteinsGate is the second collaborative work between pb and Nitroplus after ChaosHead The game was created with the concept of  science and  fantasy in mind The planning for SteinsGate was headed by Chiyomaru Shikura of pb The characters were designed by Ryohei Fuke also known as Huke known as one of the illustrators of Metal Gear series and the creator of Black Rock Shooter franchise whereas the gadgets were designed by Shrp Naotaka Hayashi of pb wrote the scenario with assistance from Vio Shimokura of Nitroplus Tatsuya Matsuhara from pb was the producer and Tos Pehara from Nitroplus was the art director The music was composed by Takeshi Abo of pb and Toshimichi Isoe of Zizz Studio Shikura Hayashi Matsuhara Abo and Isoe had all previously worked on ChaosHead The title SteinsGate had no specific meaning being coined from the German word Stein meaning stone and tying in with famous physicist Albert Einstein Matsuhara who came up with the concept of the phone trigger system stated that he initially wanted to incorporate the players own mobile phone into the system However the idea was abandoned due to concerns that it might clash with Japans privacy laws When asked if the phone trigger system would be used in a possible sequel to the game Hayashi stated that he hoped this would not be the case and recalled saying who thought of this system while writing the contents of the text messages While Shikura did not directly contribute to the script itself Hayashi stated that Shikura helped with the overall plot and provided assistance with the second half of the story In particular Shikura helped a lot with the timetraveling aspects of the story Hayashi stated that while he did not want the script to repeat the same text over and over again it was ultimately unavoidable due to the player having to travel back in time so he tried to emphasize the overall tempo of the plots development and how the plot unfolded With regards to the theme of time traveling Hayashi had felt that it seemed like an overdone topic and expressed concern over it when he first heard the idea from ShikuraPrior to the games announcement a teaser site was featured on pbs website that simply referred to the game as Project SG and stating that it was going to be a collaboration between pb and Nitroplus Nitropluss website had also hinted at this on its th anniversary website Matsuhara who was also the producer for ChaosHead had previously stated that the game would be centred on Akihabara and that the project with Nitroplus would be the second part in a series around the theme Science Novels  Kagaku Noberu On June   the countdown expired and the name SteinsGate was revealed Kana Hanazawa stated that she was happy to have been selected to be in SteinsGate as she felt that it was not common to be able to play a part in a serious game She also thought that the game
