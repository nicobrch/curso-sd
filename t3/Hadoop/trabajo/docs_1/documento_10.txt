and releaseDevelopment and staffDevilman Crybaby is based on Go Nagais manga Devilman It was produced as a Netflix original series by Aniplex and Nagais Dynamic Planning and animated by Masaaki Yuasas studio Science SARU Yuasa directed the anime Ichir kouchi wrote the script and Eunyoung Choi served as the animation producer Ayumi Kurashima was the character designer while Kiyotaka Oshiyama was responsible specifically for the demons design Although Yuasa was a fan of the original Devilman it was a project he never imagined he would work on It was Aniplex with whom he collaborated on Ping Pong the Animation  that suggested a Devilman adaptation Yuasa did Crybaby aware that Nagai was probably restrained in the depiction of its sexual and violent content by having Devilman published in a shnen young males magazine The director commented that Nagais later works were even more extreme and so he created Crybaby with the mindset of If Nagaisensei could have done as he pleased hed have gone this far Yuasa also expressed his desire in creating a sequel to Crybaby saying that if he did he could explore the different settings and ways of telling the storySettingCrybaby updates the s scenario of Nagais manga on which it is based to a stcentury setting While the manga featured delinquents who bullied Akira the anime uses rappers as substitutes for them Because of that some episodes feature extended rap sequences performed by professional rappers These rap performances function as a type of narrator throughout the series The director said he made this change because he believes rappers are the people who speak whats on their minds today It features commentaries done through rapid text messages and social media to explore humans reaction to demons Yuasa commented that the technologies and social medias popularity made the stcentury situation very close to the Devilman mangas violent scenario as people are a lot more connected for good and bad On the bad side he cited people getting shot over a video game police brutality towards AfricanAmericans the rise of nationalism in politics and problems being blamed on foreigners On the good side he mentioned people coming out as LGBT through social media and a greater acceptance of different opinions and lifestyles The series takes place in a universe in which the s Devilman TV series exists its theme song appears as a

Crybaby is a depiction of how humans can be as violent and cruel as the socalled demons Heather Alexandra of Kotaku wrote that demons are the ones doing violent actions at the start but that humans replicate their behavior as the story progresses Many critics said the persecution of demons in human disguise was a metaphor for bigotry for example Megan Farokmanseh of The Verge commented the series is an allegory about the cost of persecuting those we dont understand and attacking people perceived as different Alexandra stated the panic people create about demons is analogous to the actions of homophobia transphobia racism or other moments people see other people as the other Mike Toole of Anime News Network commented the anime depicts how fast people will be able to other suspicious or abnormal people in order to protect their own groups The Deciders Eric Thurm said the mass violence reflects the antiwar narrative and that the series political message is a reflection on humanitys tendency toward paranoia and willingness to turn on othersBrittany Vincent wrote for Syfycom that the series leads to an inevitable existential crisis while Bloody Disgustings Michael Pementel highlighted its existential and emotional elements Alexandra said the series endeavors to reflect on many philosophical questions including on goodness on debauchery and on being human GameSpots Kallie Plagge described it as a meditation on the meaning of being human while Lynzee Loveridge of Anime News Network wrote it questions whether or not there is a line that separates humanity from monstrosity Rob Salkowitz of Forbes wrote it also explores religion and the fragilty of social institutions Pementel also discussed the role of manipulation on starting the frenzy of violence among the population Toole commented that Crybaby discusses the proliferation of urban legends and the difficulty people have to deal with societal upheaval Anime News Networks Rose Bridges highlighted the role of mass media and technology in the anime as they should supposedly unite but instead facilitate judgmental impulses She also commented it reflected on how this judgment may devastate people internally which is symbolized by the demons emergence from the inside of peoples bodiesDevilman Crybaby was also interpreted as an allegory for puberty especially male adolescence Toole commented that the physical and mental changes Akira goes through after obtaining Devilmans powers represent metaphorically the anxiety during puberty Vincent stated it was a story about selfdiscovery and coming to terms with yourself while Allegra Frank of Polygon said the series shows a real love for young people Nick Creamer of Anime News Network called it a tale about the chaos of puberty about struggles with sexual identity and unrequited love James Beckett also commented for Anime News Network that it reflects on how young people deal with sex love and selfidentity and how it affects their sense of worth Anime News Networks Jacob Chapman said it features stories of people learning to accept themselves and love each other Bridges commented it has a positive message to LGBT watchers as it depicts the destructive nature of the closet while also showing that selfacceptance can strengthen people who are suffering The Japan Times writer Matt Schley stated that despite being an adaptation of Nagais Devilman it felt more like a spiritual successor to Kemonozume since both handle the subjects of identity prejudice religion and starcrossed loveThink of the story as a relay race where tears are passed as a baton AkiraDevilman is a crybaby and at the end he is able to make Satan cryCrybaby featured the original apocalyptic ending of the manga not featured in any other Devilman animated adaptations Daryl Surat of Otaku USA called it nihilistic while Remus Noronha of Collider commented that a sense of tragic inevitability is presented through the whole series Alexandra said the anime shows the mangas nihilism although it seems to exhibit a lot of hope near the end Kotakus Chris Person wrote that despite ending in a tragedy he does not think it is appropriate to characterize Devilman Crybaby as nihilistic because it has an emotional core and a thesis that it strongly believes in Frank commented the devastated Satans tears for Akira makes such a nihilistic ending feel not so totally hopeless Yuasa himself commented on this subject saying Crybaby focused on Ryos character While Akira is resolute about his actions from beginning to end Ryo faces doubts internal changes and struggles at least They meet as a child and Akira is the only one who supports Ryo who develops feelings for him but does not realize it Akiras role is to teach Ryo something and the storys essential point is about what Ryo learns in the end and in the end its about loveEpisodesAll episodes were written by Ichir kouchiReceptionAudience responseDevilman Crybabys

described as not for the faint of heart or weak of heart Auty of GameSpot stated it has pushed back the boundaries of what type of content can be shown in a streaming service and wrote an entire article dedicated to why the series has some of the most extreme content ever to hit Netflix Toole stated it is the most ludicrously violent sexedup anime TV series ever aired while Joyce Slaton wrote

and that it was more suitable for the public of the s with its ultraviolent films like Akira Demon City Shinjuku or Violence Jack On the other hand Chapman of Anime News Network felt it was not difficult to bear the violence because of Yuasas supercartoony styleWhile Peters of ComicBookcom and Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network said most of the content was gratuitous Farokhmanesh of The Verge disagreed saying it is a tool used to demonstrate the overindulgent sometimes disgusting nature of being human Likewise Sanchez of IGN deemed it to be one of the rare graphic action anime that has an incredible story to back up Peters said it is as harrowing as it is thoughtprovoking while Pementel of Bloody Disgusting commented its violence cuts on an intimate level because of the themes it evokes Beckett concluded the series features a poetical vision and that its focus on personal experiences makes it intimate despite the violence Alexandra of Kotaku was divided on the topic while understanding the storys focus on humans vileness and indulgency she described it as occasionally distracting and said the amount of violence makes it lose its impact fast Kotakus Person commented that the sexual depictions were deeply silly and fit the plot since the first part is about sexs ludicrosity and absurdity especially to young people However Alexandra also highlighted how the camera frames several woman in the most lustful way possible while Loveridge of Anime News Network stated it demonizes female sexuality as all demons in the Sabbath are female and their demon traits are based on their sex organs which then devour the menMany critics commented about the remarkable animation style as reported Pementel It was considered one of the most visually striking anime of all time by Loveridge while it has been described as  visually enthralling by Thurm and visually stunning by Matt Kamen for GamesRadar and by Frank Theron Martin of Anime News Network commented you wont see a more  outlandish visual spectacle in anime this season Loveridge called it a visual trip unlike any other while Salkowitz of Forbes stated that the series breaks out the most eyemelting psychedelia seen on the small screen since MTVs Liquid Television Writing for Otaku USA Vincent said Yuasas signature fluid animation  transforms what could have ultimately been an unattractive gorefest into an attractive ballet of human and demonic interaction Daniel Kurland of Den of Geek said that theres nothing too special about Devilman at its surface level but that Yuasas injection of his eyepopping animation and art direction turns the story into something specialAnother aspect of Devilman Crybaby that was commended includes its pumping and pulsing soundtrack which Inoa qualified as so good it is an outright tragedy that it isnt available on Spotify Musically the rap sequences were praised both by fans and specialized media like Hypebeast Others including Creamer of Anime News Network praised the rich characterization Surat of Otaku USA commented The key is characterization which he praised for not being limited to just Akira and Ryo Toole enjoyed how Miki was no more a mere plot device that she was in the manga and the punks reconceptualization as rappers The way it dealt with sexuality and its openly LGBT characters also received praise Surat said many strongly resonate with Crybaby for its emphasis on explicitly gay and lesbian characters in a dramatic presentation Person liked the fact that there were empathetic depictions from both genders of the difficulty of being oneself and its explicit and metaphorical queer presence Farokhmanesh also found its unwavering acceptance of storylines like queer romance to be refreshing and praised its subversion of toxic masculinity The ending was divisive PewDiePie considered it flat and a fatal flaw in the series while Frank deemed its beautiful devastating finale to be perfectionCrybaby has generally been considered to be faithful to the original manga maintaining its sexual and violent content Surat declared it to be perhaps the most faithful animated adaptation of it Egan of Paste stated it is as orgiastically violent and unflinchingly risqu as Nagais original manga Toole said that at first Devilman Crybaby  appears to be a straight take on Nagais classic story and also compared the first episodes to the  original video animation of Devilman Vincent considered it to be the best iteration of Devilman to have ever existed because of Yuasas animation Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network concluded that it elevates the material into something else entirely a spectacularly gay firestorm a screaming crying apocalypse that takes hold of you the moment it starts and never lets goNotesReferencesExternal linksOfficial website in JapaneseDevilman Crybaby on Netflix Devilman Crybaby at IMDb Devilman Crybaby at Rotten TomatoesDevilman Crybaby anime at Anime News
