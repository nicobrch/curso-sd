characters In addition to the One Piece franchise the character appears in a number of manga and anime series and collaborative video games His critical reception is largely positiveCreation and conceptionDevelopmentWhen Eiichiro Oda created Luffy he strove for a manliness similar to that of Akira Toriyamas Dragon Ball series Oda said that he named his main character Luffy because he felt that the name suited him When he later learned about the sailing term luffing he was delighted by the coincidence In his prototype oneshot Romance Dawn Oda refined the artistic style and story elements before publishing the final product a year later as the first chapter of One Piece In the second version of Romance Dawn Luffy resembled his design at the beginning of the series After the oneshot of One Piece was made Oda contacted his former mentor Nobuhiro Watsuki whom he assisted in making the manga Rurouni Kenshin Watsuki was pleased with Luffys characterization and advised Oda to briefly change him for the main series to make it look like Luffy is always acting on his own free will To please his readers Oda added rubberization to Luffy for comic effect and tries to make the character straightforward In retrospect Watsuki felt characters like Luffy reflect a trend of heroes who do not kill their enemies similar to his character Himura KenshinPortrayalsIn the original Japanese version of the One Piece  anime series and later spinoffs of the franchise Luffy is voiced by Mayumi Tanaka Tanaka said jokingly that she regrets providing Luffys voice because she is a mother in real life and Luffy is much younger Asked about her voicing Tanaka said that she strives for reality in scenes where Luffy speaks when he is eating or touching his nose In the OVA Defeat the Pirate Ganzack Luffy was voiced by Urara TakanoThe character was voiced by Erica Schroeder in kids Entertainments Englishlanguage dubs of the franchise between  Following FunimationCrunchyrolls acquisition of the franchise license in  Colleen Clinkenbeard became the voice of Luffy in all Englishlanguage releasesIn the live action adaptation of One Piece Luffy is portrayed by Mexican actor Iaki GodoyDescriptionLuffy is usually recognizable by his straw hat a gift from RedHaired Shanks In his early childhood he wears a white shirt and blue shorts The character has a scar under his left eye from stabbing himself to demonstrate his courage to Shanks and his crew He later wears a red vest denim shorts and sandals before replacing his vest with a red unbuttoned sea captains coat revealing the Xshaped scar on his chest he received from Akainu and a yellow sash tied around his waist In an interview Eiichiro Oda said Luffys realworld nationality analogue is BrazilianPersonalityLuffy is portrayed as a carefree funloving happygolucky character with great ambition and a huge appetite often thinking with his stomach and comically gorging himself Optimistic and generally goodhearted he is not as dimwitted as many believe him to be and he often demonstrates more understanding than the other characters expect Knowing the danger ahead Luffy is willing to risk his life to become King of the Pirates and protect his crew A capable and reliable captain he never puts his crew or himself at risk out of incompetence During the Loguetown story arc Smoker a navy captain at the time says that Luffy enjoys playing stupid Luffy responds with a mysterious smileHe enlists Chopper and Brook for his crew not just for their personality or appearance but also because of his instinctive ability to read people Luffy needs key jobs filled by his crew cook navigator medic musician and shipwright filled by Sanji Nami Chopper Brook and Franky respectively At the beginning of the series he said that he wanted at least ten crew members with abilities he felt necessary for his goal Despite his carefree personality each crew member respects him in their own way Luffy is rarely concerned about the consequences of his actions doing what he feels is right at the moment even if it leads to retaliation by a powerful force He is an extremely loyal captain who has demonstrated throughout the series that he is willing to risk his life for the wellbeing of his crewAbilitiesDevil FruitLuffys rubber attributes are a result of him eating a devil fruit called the GumGum Fruit Granting him a rubberlike body his powers make him immune to electric attacks and most blunt forces but he is susceptible to attacks made with a sharp object or weapon eg sword spear His rubber devil fruit powers grant him the ability to stretch his body at will He uses his elasticity to accelerate part or all of his body to deliver punches kicks head butts and many other varied attacks as seen throughout the series Although like others who have eaten a Devil Fruit Luffy cannot swim when he is submerged in water or contacts the SeaPrism Stone he loses his strength and cannot move on his own In addition to his Devil Fruit powers he has immense strength durability speed reflexes agility endurance and staminaLuffys signature attack is the GumGum Pistol  Gomu Gomu no Pisutoru a punch which he learned during years of training Another technique developed later in the series is Gear   Gia Sekando which increases his strength and speed for a short time but strains his body and can shorten his lifespan if used too long Observing CPs Shave  Soru technique Luffy adapts the move to his rubber body and matches the assassins speed Gear   Gia Sdo another technique uses air in his bones to attack but makes him shrink afterward Luffy can use both techniques simultaneously after the two year time skip he gains better control of these techniques and is no longer affected by their drawbacksLuffy develops another technique Gear   Gia Fsu similar to Gear  inflating his muscles with air to increase the size of his body except for his legs while his limbs are coated in Armament Haki In contrast to Gears  and  Luffy uses compression rather than extension for his attacks compressing and releasing his limbs to dish out devastating blows The force of his kicks are to an extent that he uses them to fly in a similar fashion to CPs Moon Walk  Gepp techniqueLater it is revealed that the GumGum Fruits real name is the HumanHuman Fruit Model Nika a Mythical Zoantype Devil Fruit whose awakening grants Luffys rubberlike body increased strength and freedom including turning the environment and other living beings into rubber which is limited only by the users imagination It is for this reason that the user is said to become the embodiment of freedom able to bring joy to the people around them and making it the most ridiculous power in the world In Gear   Gia Fifusu Luffys hair and clothes also turn white The World Government renamed it to erase the fruits original name from history and reclassified it as a Paramecia in order to conceal its true nature The fruit was originally a treasure sought by the World Government for over  years until it was stolen by Redhaired Shanks According to the Five Elders the fruit had not been awakened for centuries prior to Luffys having done soHakiLuffy has the ability to use Haki  ambition This ability has three types Armament Haki  Busshoku no Haki an armorlike force which can amplify defense and the force of attacks and negate a Devil Fruit users defense allow physical contact and damage Observation Haki  Kenbunshoku no Haki a sixth sense which can read a persons moves and detect their presence and Conquerors Haki  Hashoku no Haki which can render weakwilled people or animals near him unconscious Luffy learns all those types of Haki and uses them with his improved attacks As a result of his encounter with Magellan he has also developed an immunity to poison although it is shown that a strong poison may affect him albeit very slowly During his fight against Charlotte Katakuri Luffy gains an advanced form of Observation Haki Called Future Sight to see several seconds into the future During his time at Udon prison in Wano Luffy gains two new advanced forms of Armament Haki The first one is called Emission to shoot a short blast of Haki from a distance while the second one is called Internal Destruction which can also go inside his targets body or objects and destroy it from within During his fight with Kaidou at the top of Onigashima Luffy unlocks an advanced form of Conquerors Haki It is the ability to coat his entire body with it similar to Armament Haki which could further enhance his attacksBountyThroughout One Piece the bounty placed on Luffy continually increases as he faces off against increasingly powerful pirates representing his notoriety in the One Piece world After
