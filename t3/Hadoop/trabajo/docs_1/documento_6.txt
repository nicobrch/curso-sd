divided into three superpowers similar to the world of Nineteen EightyFour by George Orwell the Holy Britannian Empire the Americas also called Britannia the Chinese Federation Asia and the Europa United Europe and Africa The story takes place after the Holy Britannian Empires conquest of Japan on August   atb by means of Britannias newest weapon the Autonomous Armored Knight or Knightmare Frame In turn Britannia effectively strips Japan and its citizens of all rights and freedoms and renames the country Area  with its citizens referred to as ElevensThe point of divergence for this timeline appears to be that during the reign of Elizabeth I though the queen remained unmarried she bore a son the fictional ancestor of the Britannian Emperors Henry IXPlotLelouch vi Britannia is an exiled Britannian prince son of Emperor Charles zi Britannia and his royal consort Marianne vi Britannia Lelouch has a sister Nunnally vi Britannia Marianne was brutally murdered in the palace and

security After the siblings are sent to Japan Japan is attacked and defeated by Britannia With the ruins of Japan as a background Lelouch vows to his Japanese friend Suzaku Kururugi that he will one day obliterate Britannia as an act of vengeance against his fatherSeven years later Lelouch now going by the name Lelouch Lamperouge is now a popular yet withdrawn student at Ashford Academy Lelouch becomes involved in a terrorist attack and finds a mysterious girl called CC C who saves Lelouchs life from the Britannian Royal Guard by making a contract with him and granting Lelouch a power known as Geass  Giasu This power also known as the Power of Kings   no Chikara allows him to command anyone to do whatever he wants including bending their will to live fight or die on his behalf  This

battle Suzaku a resistance member named Kallen Stadtfeld the strongest army in the world his own halfsiblings and many others in a battle that will forever change the worldProductionCode Geass began as a concept developed at Sunrise by Ichir kouchi and Gor Taniguchi who proposed it to producer Yoshitaka Kawaguchi Kawaguchi had previously approached Okouchi and Taniguchi during the production of Planetes The basic idea for the plot consisted of a hero who led a secret organization which was later developed into a conflict between two characters with different values and who belonged to the same military unit who eventually became Lelouch Lamperouge and Suzaku KururugiDuring these initial planning stages Kawaguchi also contacted the noted manga artist group Clamp This was the first time Clamp had ever been requested to design the characters of an anime series Clamp signed onto the project early during these development stages and provided numerous ideas which helped develop the series setting and charactersWhile developing the character designs for Lelouch the protagonist of the series Clamp had originally conceived of his hair color as being white Ageha Ohkawa head writer at Clamp said she had visualized him as being a character to which everyone could relate to as being cool literally a beauty During these planning stages Clamp and the Sunrise staff had discussed a number of possible inspirations for the characters including KinKi Kids and Tackey  Tsubasa They had wanted to create a hit show a series which would appeal to everyone Lelouchs alter ego Zero was one of the earliest developed characters with kouchi having wanted a mask to be included as a part of the series feeling it was necessary for it to be a Sunrise show and Clamp wanting a unique design never prior seen in any Sunrise series said mask was nicknamed tulip for its distinctive designThe concept for the Geass may have been inspired by the Irish and Welsh legends of Geas or Geis A geas is a compulsion laid on someone to do or not do something While the geas itself does not lie on any spectrum the benefits or actions of it may be decidedly benevolent or malevolent The concept fits in into the wider fictional world and its lore of British inspirationsClamps finalized original character design art illustrated by its lead artist Mokona was subsequently converted into animation character designs for the series by Sunrises character designer Takahiro Kimura who had previously spent every day analyzing Clamps art and style from their artbooks and manga series In working on the animation character designs he focused on designing them so as to enable the series other animators to apply them without deviating from Clamps original art styleThe music for the series was composed by Ktar Nakagawa and Hitomi Kuroishi who had earlier worked with the series core staff in Planetes and Taniguchis earlier work Gun X Sword In addition to the incidental music featured in each episode Kuroishi also composed numerous insert songs for the series including Stories Masquerade Alone and Innocent Days which were each performed by Kuroishi herself while Picaresque and Callin were performed by the singersongwriter Mikio Sakai who had also earlier worked with Nakagawa and Kuroishi in Planetes The bands FLOW Ali Project Jinn SunSet Swish Access and Orange Range have provided songs for the opening and ending themes in the original broadcastWhen the series was being developed for broadcast on MBS TV it had been given the networks Saturday evening prime time slot which was later changed to a Thursday late night time slot Due to this change the overall outlook and some elements of the series were changed and further developed to suit the more mature late night audience The supernatural Geass ability finally came into the show at this point and was first conceived as a special power granted by an angel to the main characters though this last part was also modifiedMediaAnimeCode Geass officially premiered on the Mainichi Broadcasting System MBS television station on October    JST on October   Its satellite television premiere across Japan on Animax was

Todd Ciolek attributes the soaring popularity of Code Geass to the series hitting every important fan sector with the audience appeal points ranging from a complex cast of characters and a fastpaced story told with Goro Taniguchis capable direction for generalinterest fans to pretty and justalittlebroken heroes for yaoibuying female fans Carl Kimlinger also finds that the series has the skill and energy to carry viewers over the top with it where they can spend a pleasurable few hours reveling in its melodramatic charms He also adds that Taniguchi executes the excesses of his series with care skillfully intercutting events as Lelouchs plans come together or fall apart and using kinetic mecha combatTHEM Anime Reviews reviewer Dallas Marshall gave the series  out of  stars stating a melodramatic piece of science fiction that has more than enough going for it in terms of action and visuals but tends to go overboard with its emotionalism If this minor flaw can be overlooked there is an epic story to be told with a rather intriguing main character at the helm Take away one star if that minor flaw cannot be ignoredA less favorable review was given by Carlo Santos of Anime News Network who gave it an overall C and wrote that the franchise in a way  reflects the malaise of a generation the realization that old rich powerful people have screwed up the world and that the young are helpless to do anything about it According to him Lelouchs actions exemplify the wish to see problems like economic collapse class conflict political instability radical extremism solved by Zeros vigilante methods but Santos expresses doubt in such an approach and concludes that the series is at its best when raising questions rather than offering a final solution the review is focused on the manga adaptation of the story which has certain differences compared with the original animeHome video salesWhen the first episode was shown during a special test screening which was attended by kawa
