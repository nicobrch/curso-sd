Media Works Dengeki Gs Magazine Around the time Key completed the first release of their sixth visual novel Little Busters Ysuke Toba of Aniplex himself a fan of Keys works approached Maeda around October  about collaborating to produce an original anime series Maeda began meeting with Toba and Aniplex on a monthly basis and the story started to gradually progress Aniplex wanted Maeda to write a screenplay that would be very Keylike with touching moments of laughter and tears but initially Maeda found himself at a loss to write a story more amusing than Little Busters because he thought that he had reached a limit with Little Busters in regards to a Keylike story However one day Maeda was struck by inspiration where he thought up the initial idea of a story set in the afterlife Furthermore with everyone already dead Maeda conceived of flashy battles where the combatants go all out without fear of death According to Maeda the theme of the series is life which in Angel Beats is depicted as a precious and wonderful thing despite the characters in Angel Beats who fight against their fateMaeda nominated NaGa to begin work on the character designs near the beginning of  NaGa was worried that other computer graphics CG work for Key would get delayed but he took the position because of his accumulated experience in CG Maeda nominated NaGa because of the popular characters he designed in Little Busters and because of his frankness NaGa designed Yuri based on her personality as a leader though it was per Maedas request that he added the black headband taken from the character Yukiko Amagi from Persona  who was Maedas favorite heroine from that game The length of Yuris hair and the addition of a green ribbon were decided at production committee meetings Angels original concept began with the idea of a brave fighting girl Maeda cited that Angels image had changed considerably over the development process and that originally she was similar to Shiki Rygi from Kara no Kykai Eventually Angels concept changed to being a silent and mysterious girl Before NaGa decided on Otonashis design Maeda told him that anything would be fine and to just draw something and eventually drew up a prototype for Otonashi and Hinata among others Some of the characters had vague initial conditions given by Maeda such as asking NaGa to draw an all female band bass guitarist in the case of Girls Dead Monster member Sekine and particularly the cryptic character who speaks in puzzling English phrases for TKDevelopmentThe Aniplex producer of Angel Beats Ysuke Toba was interviewed in the November  issue of Dengeki Gs Magazine where he commented that a episode anime with about  minutes per episode was not enough to tell the whole story of Angel Beats Maeda had envisioned Therefore the various additional media such as the illustrated short stories and manga contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings when he was in the process of writing the script and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it Maeda composed about  songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose including the lyrics Due to this Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats which Maeda also composed sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songsIn regards to bringing in PA Works as the animation studio Toba had taken notice of the company back when they provided inbetween animation and production assistance for Fullmetal Alchemist  and Darker than Black  respectively Aniplex helped produce both series After watching just the first three episodes of PA Works True Tears  however he was shocked at the high quality and immediately went to PA Works studio in Toyama Prefecture to meet with the production staff in the hope that one day Aniplex could collaborate with them on a project together The following week Maeda brought up the subject of deciding on an animation studio for Angel Beats and mentioned that he too had seen True Tears and had become interested in PA Works Shortly after that Toba formally made the proposal to PA Works to animate the projectMaeda focused on making jokes an important part of Angel Beats leading Toba to seek out Seiji Kishi to be the director because of his experience in directing and his pulling power influence on the staff of PA Works where there are many that are still young Kishi was ultimately approached by PA Works representative director Kenji Horikawa about working on a school comedy written by a game scenario writer and was shocked after taking the directors position to discover Maeda was the screenwriter Kishi commented how far from just being a comedy the series contains many different aspects including flashy action scenes live musical performances and drama Kishi stated that normally he would be hard pressed to cover this range of aspects but was motivated by Maedas uncompromising attitude in regards to the script The decision to add in the all female band Girls Dead Monster was due to Maedas intent to add in many different and interesting elements into the seriesKishi specifically requested that sound and music director Satoki Iida work on the project who also helped with the proofreading of the script due to Maedas fixation on the music production Iida was interviewed in the April  issue of Dengeki Gs Magazine where it was stated that Maeda and the group AnantGarde Eyes received Iidas approval to employ a minimalist approach to the background music BGM used throughout the anime Iida admitted that it was uncustomary to use this music genre in anime and that he had to go through various trials and errors with Maeda and AnantGarde Eyes to get the music right Maeda and AnantGarde Eyes strove to create individual quality music tracks while Iida pursued the goal of having music that would be useful as BGM tracks which caused problems during the creation process Iida realized that it was important for the music and the visuals to combine to create a synchronization between the two Toba first took notice of Angel Beats character designer and chief animator Katsuz Hirata during the production of Gurren Lagann  with his skill as an artist and ability to finish work quickly but thoroughly It was after Toba saw Hiratas work as chief animator of Strike Witches  however that he pursued Hirata to join the Angel Beats staff Maeda also gave his seal of approval to HirataBroadcast and distributionThe episode Angel Beats anime television series is directed by Seiji Kishi and

the manga Angel Beats The Last OperationReceptionCritical receptionAngel Beats received generally positive reviews In a review by Anime News Network reviewer Theron Martin praised the series for integrating individual elements together including the Girls Dead Monster musical performance scenes scenes where humor dominates and action scenes A common theme in supernatural anime according to Martin are souls discontent with their former lives but the concept of Angel Beats is described as quite unusual because it features all the main characters as such souls and gathers them in one place In the series maintaining distinctiveness is essential for survival as an individual which Martin calls a sly condemnation of the rigorous conformity impressed upon students by Japanese schooling Overall Angel Beats was lauded for requiring no great familiarity with anime to enjoyOn the DVD Talk website reviewer John Sinnott praised the plot for advancing and changing in unexpected ways The plot evolves quickly and by the end of the series its quite a different show than what it was at the beginning Both Martin and Sinnott agree that a major flaw in the anime is that it is too short and does not go into detail for a large number of characters Stig Hgset at THEM Anime Reviews however panned the series in part because it overloads the story with too many elements in an attempt to please as many people as possible Hgset went on to describe Angel Beats as not having any compelling characters and the series humor is largely thought to be annoying However Hgset praised PA Works for the animation of the action sequences as did Martin who added that there is great detail work on the weapons and instruments usedThe sixth episode of Angel Beats which aired on May   on Osakas MBS
