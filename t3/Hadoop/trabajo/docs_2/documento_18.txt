action scenes symbolism and philosophical referencesSynopsisSettingFullmetal Alchemist takes place in the fictional country of Amestris  Amesutorisu In this world alchemy is one of the mostpracticed sciences alchemists who work for the government are known as State Alchemists  Kokka Renkinjutsushi and are automatically given the rank of major in the military Alchemists have the ability with the help of patterns called transmutation circles to create almost anything they desire However when they do so they must provide something of equal value in accordance with the Law of Equivalent Exchange The only things alchemists are forbidden from transmuting are humans and gold There has never been a successful human transmutation those who attempt it lose a part of their body and the result is an inhuman mass Attemptees are confronted by Truth  Shinri a pantheistic and semicerebral Godlike being who tauntingly regulates all alchemy use and whose nighfeatureless appearance is relative to the person with whom Truth converses it is frequently claimed and believed that Truth is a personal God who punishes the arrogantAttemptees of human transmutation are also thrown into the Gate of Truth  Shinri no Tobira where they receive an overwhelming dose of information but also allowing them to transmute without a circle All living things possess their own Gate of Truth and per the Gaea hypothesis heavenly bodies like planets also have their own Gates of Truth It is possible to bypass the Law of Equivalent Exchange using a Philosophers Stone a red enigmatic substance Philosophers Stones are used to create Homunculi artificial humans of proud nature who are named after and embody the seven deadly sins Homunculi have numerous superhuman abilities unique among each other and look down upon all humanity With the exception of one they do not age and can only be killed via the destruction of their Philosophers StonesThere are several cities throughout Amestris The main setting is the capital of Central City  Sentoraru Shiti along with other military cities such as the northern city of Briggs  Burigguzu Towns featured include Resembool  Rizenbru the rural hometown of the Elrics

destroyed in the Ishbalan Civil War instigated after a soldier shot an Ishbalan child Outside of Amestris there are few named countries and none are seen in the main story The main foreign country is Xing Heavily reminiscent of China Xing has a complex system of clans and emperors as opposed to Amestriss governmentcontrolled election of a Fhrer It also has its own system of alchemy called alkahestry  rentanjutsu which is more medical and can be bilocated using kunai in turn it is implied that all countries have different forms of alchemyPlotEdward and Alphonse Elric live in Resembool with their mother Trisha and father Van Hohenheim For unknown reasons Hohenheim abandons them and Trisha soon dies from an illness After finishing their alchemy training under Izumi Curtis the Elrics attempt to bring their mother back with alchemy But the transmutation backfires and Edward loses his left leg while Alphonse is completely deconstructed Edward sacrifices his right arm to retrieve Alphonses soul binding it to a suit of armor Edward is invited by Roy Mustang to become a State Alchemist and research a way to restore their bodies undergoing a painful medical procedure that grants him prosthetic automail limbs Edward becomes a State Alchemist with the title of Fullmetal Alchemist The Elrics spend the next three years searching for the Philosophers Stone to achieve their goalsThe Elrics are eventually attacked by an Ishbalan serial killer known as Scar who targets State Alchemists in revenge for his peoples genocide in the Ishbalan civil war Returning to Resembool to have Edwards limbs repaired by their childhood friend and mechanic Winry Rockbell the Elrics meet Dr Marcoh who provides them with clues to learn that a Philosophers Stone is created from human souls They investigate a laboratory in which the Stones were created but are hindered by the Homunculi The Elrics decide to visit Izumi hoping to improve their alchemy Mustangs friend Maes Hughes continues

position as heir to his countrys throne the Elrics return to Central City where they learn of Hughess murder Lieutenant Maria Ross is framed for Hughes murder so Mustang fakes Rosss death and smuggles her out of the country In encounters with the Homunculi Mustang kills Lust Lin captures Gluttony who swallows Lin Edward and Envy into his voidlike stomach They escape from Gluttonys stomach after he takes Alphonse to meet Father who makes Lin the vessel of Greed Mustang tries to expose Bradley to the government but finds that the higher officials are complicit in Fathers plans The Elrics and

kidnaps Dr MarcohThe Elrics head north as well and reach Fort Briggs commanded by General Olivier Armstrong They confront the homunculus Sloth and learn that Father founded Amestris to amass enough population to create a massive Philosophers Stone With it he can achieve godhood by absorbing the being beyond the Gate of Truth on the Promised Day Forced to work with Solf Kimblee a murderous former State Alchemist and ally of the Homunculi the Elrics turn on him and split up joined by a reformed Scar his group Kimblees chimera subordinates and later LinGreed Riza Hawkeye discovers that King

Philosophers Stone Hohenheim goes to visit Trishas grave where he dies peacefullyThe Elrics return home and separate two years later to further research alchemy Years later Edward and Winry marry and have two childrenProductionDevelopmentAfter reading about the concept of the Philosophers Stone Arakawa became attracted to the idea of her characters using alchemy in the manga She started reading books about alchemy which she found complicated because some books contradict others Arakawa was attracted more by the philosophical aspects than the practical ones For the Equivalent Exchange  Tka Kkan concept she was inspired by the work of her parents who had a farm in Hokkaido and worked hard to earn the money to eatArakawa wanted to integrate social problems into the story Her research involved watching television news programs and talking to refugees war veterans and former yakuza Several plot elements such as Pinako Rockbell caring for the Elric brothers after their mother dies and the brothers helping people to understand the meaning of family expand on these themes When creating the fictional world of Fullmetal Alchemist Arakawa was inspired after reading about the Industrial Revolution in Europe she was amazed by differences in the culture architecture and clothes of the era and those of her own culture She was especially interested in England during this period and incorporated these ideas into the manga The series has a steampunk setting The Ishbal region has similarities to the Middle East with the plot anticipating elements of the Iraq War which later occurred in the real worldWhen the manga began serialization Arakawa was considering several major plot points including the ending She wanted the Elric brothers to recover their bodiesat least partly As the plot continued she thought that some characters were maturing and decided to change some scenes Arakawa said the manga authors Suih Tagawa and Hiroyuki Eto are her main inspirations for her character designs she describes her artwork as a mix of both of them She found that the easiest of the seriess characters to draw were Alex Louis Armstrong and the little animals Arakawa likes dogs so she included several of them in the story Arakawa made comedy central to the mangas story because she thinks it is intended for entertainment and tried to minimize sad scenesConclusionWhen around forty manga chapters had been published Arakawa said that as the series was nearing its end and she would try to increase the pace of the narrative To avoid making some chapters less entertaining than others unnecessary details from each of them were removed and a climax was developed The removal of minor details was also necessary because Arakawa had too few pages in Monthly Shnen Gangan to include all the story content she wanted to add Some characters appearances were limited in some chapters At first Arakawa thought the series would last  volumes but the length increased to  Serialization finished after nine years and Arakawa was satisfied with her work because she had told everything she wanted with the mangaDuring the development of the first anime Arakawa allowed the anime staff to work independently from her and requested a different ending from that of the manga She said that she would not like to repeat the same ending in both media and wanted to make the manga longer so she could develop the characters When watching the ending of the anime she was amazed about how different the homunculi creatures were from the manga and enjoyed how the staff speculated about the origins of the villains Because Arakawa helped the Bones staff in the making of the series she was kept from focusing on the mangas cover illustrations and had little time to make themThemes and analysisThe series explores social problems including discrimination scientific advancement political greed brotherhood family and war Scars backstory and his hatred of the state military references the Ainu people who had their land taken by other people This includes the consequences of guerrilla warfare and the number of violent soldiers a military can have Some of the people who took the Ainus land were originally Ainu this irony is referenced in Scars use of alchemy to kill alchemists even though it was forbidden in his own religion The Elrics being orphans and adopted by Pinako Rockbell reflects Arakawas beliefs about the ways society should treat orphans The characters dedication to their occupations reference the need to work for food The series also explores the concept of equivalent exchange to obtain something new one must pay with something of equal value This is applied by alchemists when creating new materials and is also a philosophical belief the Elric brothers followPublicationWritten and drawn by Hiromu Arakawa Fullmetal Alchemist was serialized in Square Enixs monthly manga magazine Monthly Shnen Gangan Its first installment was
