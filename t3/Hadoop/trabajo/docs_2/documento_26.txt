to all of the intelligent races native to the planet including humans anthropomorphic beings and monsters Starting from the Dragon Ball Z series various extraterrestrial species such as the Saiyans  Saiyajin and Namekians  Namekkuseijin have played a more prominent role in franchise mediaThe narrative of Dragon Ball predominantly follows the adventures of the Saiyan Son Goku upon meeting Bulma at the beginning of the series the two embark on an adventure to gather the seven Dragon Balls a set of orbs that summon the wishgranting dragon Shenlongch  Goku later receives martial arts training from

tyrant Freeza this sets the tone of the rest of the series with each enemy the characters face becoming stronger than the last requiring them to attain further trainingDragon Ball Super establishes that the franchise is set in a multiverse composed of twelve numbered universes with the majority of the Dragon Ball series taking place in Universe   DaiNana Uch lit Number Seven Universe Each universe is ruled by a number of benevolent and malevolent deities respectively called Kaioshin and Gods of Destruction who are appointed by a higher being called Zeno who watches over the multiverseProductionAkira Toriyama was a fan of Hong Kong martial arts films particularly Bruce Lee films such as Enter the Dragon  and Jackie Chan films such as Drunken Master  and wanted to create a manga inspired by martial arts films This led to Toriyama creating the  oneshot manga Dragon Boy which he later redeveloped into Dragon Ball Toriyama loosely modeled the plot and characters of Dragon Ball on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West with Goku being Sun Wukong Son Goku in Japanese Bulma as Tang Sanzang Oolong as Zhu Bajie and Yamcha being Sha Wujing Toriyama wanted to create a story with the basic theme of Journey to the West but with a little kung fu by combining the novel with elements from the kung fu films of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee The title Dragon Ball was inspired by Enter the Dragon and later Bruceploitation knockoff kung fu films which frequently had the word Dragon in the title and the fighting scenes were influenced by Jackie Chan movies Since it was serialized in a shnen manga magazine he added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give it a gamelike activity of gathering something without thinking of what the characters would wish for His concept of the Dragon Balls was inspired by the epic Japanese novel Nans Satomi Hakkenden  which involves the heroes collecting eight Buddhist prayer beads which Toriyama adapted into collecting seven Dragon BallsHe originally thought it would last about a year or end once the Dragon Balls were collected Toriyama stated that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand he specifically aimed Dragon Ball at readers older than those of his previous serial Dr Slump He also wanted to break from the Western influences common in Dr Slump deliberately going for Chinese scenery referencing Chinese buildings and photographs of China his wife had bought Toriyama wanted to set Dragon Ball in a fictional world largely based on Asia taking inspiration from several Asian cultures including Japanese Chinese South Asian Central Asian Arabic and Indonesian cultures The island where the Tenkaichi Budkai is held is modeled after Bali in Indonesia which he his wife and assistant visited in mid and for the area around Bobbidis spaceship he consulted photos of Africa Toriyama was also inspired by the jinn genies from The Arabian NightsDuring the early chapters of the manga Toriyamas editor Kazuhiko Torishima commented that Goku looked rather plain To combat this he added several characters like KameSennin and Kuririn and created the Tenkaichi Budkai martial arts tournament to focus the storyline on fighting It was when the first Tenkaichi Budkai began that Dragon Ball truly became popular having recalled the races and tournaments in Dr Slump Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory This allowed for more character growth as the manga progressed He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline was inspired by the video game Spartan X called KungFu Master in the West in which enemies appear very fast as the player ascends a tower the game was in turn inspired by Jackie Chans Wheels on Meals and Bruce Lees Game of Death He then created Piccolo Daimao as a truly evil villain and as a result called that arc the most interesting to drawOnce Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans  Saiyajin and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby Freeza who forcibly took over planets to resell them was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators whom Toriyama called the worst kind of people Finding the escalating enemies difficult he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan  Sp Saiyajin transformation during the Freeza arc he was initially concerned that Gokus facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger Gokus Super Saiyan form has blonde hair because it was easier to draw for Toriyamas assistant who spent a lot of time blacking in Gokus hair and has piercing eyes based on Bruce Lees paralyzing glare Dragon Ball Z anime character designer Tadayoshi Yamamuro also used Bruce Lee as a reference for Gokus Super Saiyan form stating that when he first becomes a Super Saiyan his slanting pose with that scowling look in his eyes is all Bruce Lee Toriyama later added time travel during the Cell arc but said he had a hard time with it only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo After Cells death Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series protagonist but later felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mindGoing against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size he designed many of Dragon Balls most powerful characters with small statures including the protagonist Goku Toriyama later explained that he had Goku grow up as a means to make drawing fight scenes easier even though his first editor Kazuhiko Torishima was initially against it because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically When including fights in the manga Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid difficulties in drawing residents and destroyed buildings Toriyama said that he did not plan the details of the story resulting in strange occurrences and discrepancies later in the series including changing the colors of the characters midstory and few characters having screentone because he found it difficult to use Since the completion of Dragon Ball Toriyama has continued to add to its story mostly background information on its universe through guidebooks published by ShueishaDuring the second half of the series Toriyama has said that he had become more interested in coming up with the story than actually drawing it and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines In  he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed so he did not draw very elaborate going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an unconventional and contradictory story In  commenting on Dragon Balls global success Toriyama said Frankly I dont quite understand why it happened While the manga was being serialized the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through I dare say I dont care even if my works have left nothing behind as long as they have entertained their readersMangaWritten and illustrated by Akira Toriyama Dragon Ball was serialized in the manga anthology Weekly Shnen Jump from December   to June   when Toriyama grew exhausted and felt he needed a break from drawing The  individual chapters were published into  tankbon volumes by Shueisha from September   through August   Between December   and April   the chapters were rereleased in a

All Time Gokus journey and his evergrowing strength resulted in the character winning the admiration of young boys everywhere Manga artists such as One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda and Naruto creator Masashi Kishimoto have stated that Goku inspired their series main protagonists as well as series structureManga critic Jason Thompson stated in  that Dragon Ball is by far the most influential shnen manga of the last  years and today almost every Shnen Jump artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways He says the series turns from a gagadventure manga to an nearlypure fighting manga and its basic formula of lots of martial arts lots of training sequences a few jokes became the model for other shnen series such as Naruto Thompson also called Toriyamas art influential and cited it as a reason for the series popularity James S Yadao author of The Rough Guide to Manga claims that the first several chapters of Dragon Ball play out much like Saiyuki with Dr Slumplike humour built in and that Dr Slump Toriyamas previous manga has a clear early influence on the series He feels the series established its unique identity after the first occasion when Gokus group disbands and he trains under KameSennin when the story develops a far more actionpacked sinister tone with wilder battles with aerial and spiritual elements and an increased death count while humor still makes an occasional appearance Yadao claims that an art shift occurs when the characters lose the rounded innocent look that he established in Dr Slump and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensityAnimerica felt the series had worldwide appeal using dramatic pacing and overthetop martial arts action to maintain tension levels and keep a crippler crossface hold on the audiences attention spans In Little Boy The Art of Japans Exploding Subculture Takashi Murakami commented that Dragon Balls neverending cyclical narrative moves forward plausibly seamlessly and with great finesse Ridwan Khan from Animefringecom commented that the manga had a chubby art style but as the series continued the characters got more refined leaner and more muscular

personalities Divers also called Vizs translation one of the best of all the English editions of the series due to its faithfulness to the original Japanese D Aviva Rothschild of Rationalmagiccom
