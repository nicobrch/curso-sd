book writers of San Diego ComicCon listed Mob Psycho  as one of the Most Wanted Manga from  Mob Psycho  won the nd Shogakukan Manga Award in the shnen category in  The series was nominated for a Harvey Award in the Best Manga category in Critical receptionIan Wolf from Anime UK News praised the first two volumes of the series giving them  out of  and stated Ones art is notable for a few reasons The art is designed to be humorous rather than stylish Part of the comedy value in Ones work is the rough styling that adds to the scenarios he creates In this second volume of Mob Psycho  it is the action which is the main focus There is some comedy thrown into the mix as well but mainly this time it is about the battle between the two psychics and their different philosophies It is also interesting to witness this fight because it is one in which one of the participants is trying their hardest not to fight while the other is giving it all theyve got Having said this there is still some comedy added to the heat of the battle the main highlight being when Teru tries to use knives to beat Mob but Mob deflects one of the knives away accidentally cutting off a massive chunk of Terus hair It is at times like this where Ones art style can sometimes fall down His rough artwork does lead neatly to the chaotic scenes he is trying to depict at the height of the fight but when it comes to the more dramatic moments the rough style lacks pathos Here the anime has the edge when it depicts the fight because other elements such as the music or the use of colour can add to the tensionAnimeIn the Crunchyrolls inaugural Anime Awards the first season of the anime series received two awards Best Action and Best Fight Scene Shigeo vs Koyama It was also nominated in six other
