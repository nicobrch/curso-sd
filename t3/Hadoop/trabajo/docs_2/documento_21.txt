opinion which influences Tsunemori to stay on the force The unit uncovers the crimes of Shogo Makishima a prolific criminal mastermind Makishima is Criminally Asymptomatic  Menzai Taishitsu  a person

Shinya Kogami Kana Hanazawa as Akane Tsunemori and Takahiro Sakurai as Shogo Makishima PsychoPass originated from Production IGs interest in making a successor to Mamoru Oshiis Ghost in the Shell and Patlabor hiring Katsuyuki Motohirowho became the series chief directorand veteran IG animator Naoyoshi Shiotani to supervise directionMotohiro wanted to return to making anime after a long hiatus but he needed a charismatic script writer Motohiro and his staff were surprised with Gen Urobuchis contribution to the highly acclaimed anime series Puella Magi Madoka Magica Motohiro was fascinated by Madoka Magica and he had read other works by Urobuchi which persuaded him to talk to Urobuchi In early  Motohiro proposed to Urobuchi that the pair should work together Early in the making of the series Motohiro told Naoyoshi Shiotani not to make anything that could not be adapted into a liveaction filmBefore work on PsychoPass started Shiotani was busy working on the film BloodC The Last Dark As soon as his work with the film ended Shiotani focused on the series quality After episode  which proved to be the most challenging and popular of the series the team found themselves out of stamina The next two episodes were made by an outside team which is reflected in several problems with the animation In response to this the producer of the episode said that while he expected problems he worked to make it the best he could Shiotani also apologized for the episodes quality The original team continued working from episode  on until the finale deciding to remake episodes  and  for their retail release The anime series was first announced in late March  by Fuji TV at its Noitamina press conferenceDesignWhen hearing the comments from Atsuko Ishizuka director of The Pet Girl of Sakurasou about the way the characters were first designed Shiotani realized it was the opposite for his team who had to create the setting first then the characters because they are almost being played by the world As a result the characters were designed by manga artist Akira Amano to balance the dark atmosphere by having them palatable and very relatable The staff avoided using bright colors that would stand out Akane Tsunemori was created as the most relatable character who would question the setting from the audiences point of view and as the heroine who would come between the main character Shinya Kogami and his main rival and enemy Shogo Makishima Akanes progression from an innocent newcomer to a mature and haunted person was one of the staffs main objectivesMotohiro allowed his team to use very graphic elements even though they could reduce female viewership He acknowledged that the series may be too violent for a younger demographic and said that he would not want his son to watch it because of its psychological brutality He added that the team did not want to make a violent series but an artistic series that just happened to have some violence included in it About the amount of violence Shiotani told Urobuchi just let us deal with it Some of these violent scenes occur offcamera but whenever a protagonist was involved the moment was developed to be memorable The team twice had to remake scenes because the television station complained that they went overboardMotohiro wanted the series to counter concurrent anime trends The use of moe slang was banned at staff meetings because they appreciated dramas like Mobile Suit Gundam and Patlabor that focused on conflicts between male characters As the series was antimoe the team decided to avoid having Tsunemori remove her clothes and instead had Kogami do it Nevertheless the show attracted a female viewership because the conflict between the male characters appeared to attract the shonen ai genre fans Although Shiotani also wanted the series to avoid romance between male characters he believed the fight scenes between male characters unintentionally attracted female fans The staff decided to focus on friendships rather than romantic relationshipsInfluencesThe series was inspired by several Western films most notably LA Confidential Director Naoyoshi Shiotani cited several other influences including Minority Report Gattaca Brazil and Blade Runner the latter of which he compared very closely to PsychoPass Before the making of the series Urobuchi insisted on using a Philip K Dickinspired dystopian narrative The psychological themes were based on the time Shiotani watched Lupin III during his childhood because he thought about adding todays youth trauma to the series The rivalry between the main characters was based on the several dramas the staff liked Other voice actors have been credited in the making of the series because of the ways they added traits to the charactersMusicThe staff had problems composing an opening theme for the series until someone provided some music by Ling Tosite Sigure who was engaged to compose the opening theme Egoist who composed the ending theme had debuted on Noitamina with Guilty Crown Shiotani said they asked Egoist to record three versions of the ending theme so they could alternate them to match the episodes ending Across the series time limits resulted in the ending songs being removed or replaced with instrumental versions to avoid cutting scenes from the episode When there were concerns from the producers of the songs Tomohiro and Shiotani discussed this with them Following the first series Yugo Kanno made remixes of the original background themes as the staff found them enjoyable and might come across as appealing in the processTwo PsychoPass CDs were included in the second and fifth Japanese home media release of the series The Psycho Pass original soundtrack was released by Sony Music Entertainment on May   It features fiftyfive tracks composed by Kanno The second original soundtrack was released on March   A twovolume drama CD called Namae no nai kaibutsu  lit The Monster with no Name based on the prequel novel was released between September  and November  PsychoPass Complete Original SoundtrackThemes and analysisAs some critics have noted PsychoPass explores societal and psychological themes such as the price of living without stress or fear of crime Indeed the Sibyl System targets individuals who are considering performing actions that might cause stress to others This raises the question of whether it is morally and socially acceptable to charge individuals with crimes they have not yet committed An example of this occurs in the first episode when a woman is kidnapped and the resultant trauma causes her PsychoPass to become clouded According to Sibyls rules the police can decompose her but Tsunemori delays action choosing to bring the womans PsychoPass level back to the acceptable range by speaking gently to her This challenges the notion that the potential to commit a crime correlates with actually committing a crime According to Anime News Network We are all capable of doing bad things at timesshould we be punished because we thought of hurting someone before we act on it Or because we were victims It really all comes back to that first episode and Akanes reaction to the victim who presented as a violent criminalPsychoPass further questions the notion of overriding the individuals needs in favor of general social value by asking the audience to consider if it is morally and socially acceptable to kill individuals who may potentially commit crimes so long as we accept that the harm caused to society outweighs the harm caused to an individual who is falsely charged In other words the Sibyl System operates on the principles of opportunity cost and acceptable risk Relying on the Sibyl System paradoxically creates a society which fears no crime as a whole but individuals who personally fear the consequences of the Sibyl Systems verdicts Urobuchi himself has said that one of the series central thematic ideas is fear Shogo Makishimas actions stem from feeling out of place because the Sibyl System cannot accept him as he is labeling him a deviant within the structure of society itselfEmotional repression is another theme explored in PsychoPass The identification of latent criminals is partially based on the emotions judged by society to be negative such as sadness or anger being scanned by the Sibyl System Kotaku states because of these scans PsychoPass shows an interesting future where mental beauty is as sought after as physical beauty It is also a future where the polices job is little more than to watch the latent criminals they controlbecause if they did any real detective work they might start to think like the criminals they are trying to catch and thus become latent criminals themselves Many of the main characters feel nostalgia throughout the series The many references to older literature philosophy music and theater create a nostalgic world building for a time before psychopassesMediaAnimeTV

was left unexplained DVD Talk gave high praise to Makishima because of his achievements across the story and his personality Certain episodes have been referred to as filler because they are used as a buildup to the climactic ones Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network gave high praise stating that from episode  the series was a real blast to watch and that she was glad with the development of the protagonist Akane Tsunemori However she severely criticized the plot twist regarding the Sybil Systems true identity calling it one of the stupidest revelations in the history of animeThomas Zoth from

parallelism between Tsunemoris and Kogamis development which resulted in an ambiguous ending that should be decided by the viewers The supporting cast received similar praise by DVD Talk but the
