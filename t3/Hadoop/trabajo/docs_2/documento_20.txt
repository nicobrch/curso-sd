the th Japan Media Arts Festival in PlotIn the fictional city of Mitakihara Japan a middle school student named Madoka Kaname and her best friend Sayaka Miki encounter a small catlike creature named Kyubey It offers a contract in which a girl may have any wish granted in exchange for obtaining magical powers and being tasked with fighting witches Meanwhile a transfer student and mysterious magical girl named Homura Akemi tries to stop Madoka from making the contract with Kyubey Madoka and Sayaka then meet Mami Tomoe an upperclassman at the same school who is also a magical girl Noticing their indecisiveness on whether to become a magical girl Mami offers to take Madoka and Sayaka along on her witch hunts so they may learn of the responsibilities of being a magical girlHowever after witnessing Mamis death at the hands of a witch Madoka realizes the life of a magical girl is filled with suffering and pain This is further enforced by the appearance of Kyoko Sakura a veteran magical girl whose wish unintentionally caused the death of her family Madoka also discovers magical girls give up their souls to form Soul Gems the source of their magic When a Soul Gem becomes too tainted with despair it turns into a grief seed which hatches into a witch Sayaka decides to become a magical girl after learning that doing so would allow her to heal Kyosuke a musician and friend of hers who she has a crush on However her friend Hitomi Shizuki confesses her love to him first causing Sayaka to become disillusioned and fall into an inescapable despair that turns her into a witch Kyubey reveals to Madoka that he is of an alien race that has been harvesting the emotions of magical girls for centuries to use as energy to counteract the spread of entropy and thus stave off the heat death of the universe Madoka also learns that Homura is a magical girl from a different timeline who has repeated the same month countless times to try to save Madoka from a grisly fate Madoka and Kyoko attempt to reverse Sayakas transformation but the plan fails and Kyoko is forced to sacrifice herself to allow Madoka to escape leaving Homura as the only remaining magical girl Following this an extremely powerful witch known as Walpurgisnacht approaches the city Homura attempts to stop it but is defeated She begins to lose hope and is on the verge of becoming a witch when Madoka arrives With the past months events in mind Madoka decides to become a magical girl despite Homuras efforts to stop her She makes a wish to stop the creation of all witches in the past present and future The paradoxical nature of her wish causes her to transcend into a psychopomp form called the Law of Cycles which is a new rule of the universe where magical girls are purified and disappear into a higher plane instead of becoming witches A new reality is formed in which Homura is the only one who remembers Madoka Homura vows to continue fighting in honor of Madoka and the world she cherishedProductionDevelopmentWhile collaborating on Hidamari Sketch and Bakemonogatari Akiyuki Shinbo told Aniplex producer Atsuhiro Iwakami he wanted to create a new magical girl series beginning the development of Puella Magi Madoka Magica During the early planning stage Iwakami decided not to adapt an existing work to give Shinbo more freedom in his direction style Another goal of the project was to develop an anime that would appeal to a wider audience than the usual demographic for media within the magical girl subgenre Iwakami and Shinbo intended their series to be accessible to the general anime fan Shinbo then asked Gen Urobuchi to work on the project as a scriptwriter and Ume Aoki as original character designer Takahiro Kishida was engaged to adapt Aokis character designs for the television seriesIn his role as producer Iwakami took a mostly handsoff approach Because Puella Magi Madoka Magica is an original series rather than an adaptation of an existing work his main goal was coming up with a highquality piece of entertainment After helping to recruit the staff he allowed them freedom to develop the content of the story providing minimal guidance After viewing the character designs that Aoki created he was sure he could trust the creative talent of the team In an interview with Anime News Network after the series finished airing in Japan Iwakami said I dont matter much its up to those talents to do their work If something comes to a standstill I might intervene but they did an excellent job and I was very happy seeing the results in episode oneWritingDuring the prewriting planning phase Iwakami asked Urobuchi to make the storyline heavy Shinbo specified it should contain copious amounts of blood and violence elements that were unusual in the magical girl genre Iwakami also asked for many of the magical girl characters to be killed throughout the series Urobuchi said he had no trouble with these requirements referencing his past reputation as a writer of very dark and somber stories the extent of which Shinbo had not knownOne objective was for the script to contrast starkly with the way the anime was to be marketed Shinbo planned to advertise the series innocently and purely that would deliberately conceal its dark undertones For example the title logo was rendered using rounded fonts that would appear harmless to audiences Urobuchi further misled fans by using his Twitter account to persuade them the plot of the series was innocuous The true nature of the series was disguised because Shinbo wanted its dark themes to be a complete surprise to the viewers Iwakami later defended the mature themes in the Puella Magi Madoka Magica stating the story of Madoka is serious but its not entirely inappropriate for children For example theres nothing sexually explicit in it Theres some death but its not gratuitous it can be explained within the context of the storyShinbo granted Urobuchi a large amount of autonomy in writing the series and determining the path of the story In describing his interactions with Iwakami and Shinbo while working on the series Urobuchi commented that neither one is the type to show their hand they would always wait for me to make the next move To create a successful deconstruction of the magical girl genre Urobuchi studied aspects of traditional magical girl media that were troubling or overlooked He also stated the plot development was heavily influenced by the character drawings by Aoki and credited  horror fiction author Stephen King and Shinbos previous projects such as Hidamari Sketch and Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha as inspirations for the seriesUrobuchi attributed his experience working on projects with screenwriters Ichiro Itano and Ysuke Kuroda as a major influence in his writing for Puella Magi Madoka Magica and has referred to both of them as his mentors To set the initial pacing of the series Urobuchi used a technique he credited to Kuroda The first episode would throw the viewer into a specific part of the story with unknown context The second episode would define the rules governing the storys setting The third episode would divulge the revelation in the plot to hook the viewer The twist in the third episode was determined during the project proposal stage and involves the death of Mami the main characters mentor This decision was controversial Urobuchi said production staff continually approached him and asked him to reconsider because of their fondness for the character He refused and the plot remained unchanged during production Urobuchi realized this progression could be very hard for viewers to accept and might hurt the overall series success with some audiences he said I always thought this is an age where entertainment basically is about soothing and healing like adopting a style where unchanging daytoday life is to continue foreverIn an interview with Ultra Jump Egg Urobuchi gave insight into his writing philosophy stating that he believed the overarching plot of a story was more important than its characters He said he would first determine the actions and the ultimate fate of a character before even assigning it a name and contrasted this with other writing methods that first focused on developing the characters and then creating a storyline for them to follow He again defended his decision to have Mami die saying this could have the effect of making the character more memorable saying I think there are quite many characters who became immortal exactly because they died like Caesar Zeppeli in JoJos Bizarre Adventure or Raoh in Fist of the North Star Precisely because of the way they died they were able to live foreverCharacter designUrobuchi stated that Sayaka was his favorite character overall and said her plotline was the most enjoyable to write Shinbo believed that Sayakas grim fate by the end of the series was a slightly unfair destiny and asked Urobuchi if it was possible to change the plot so Sayaka could be spared Urobuchi declined saying her death was integral to the overarching story Shinbo then asked if she could be brought back to life saying he had become very attached to the character Urobuchi again refused saying this would be impossible because of the alreadyestablished rules governing the story Shinbo acquiesced to this but said he believed there may have been too large a burden placed on the characters who were young middleschool girlsThe alien character Kyubey was also envisioned and designed by Urobuchi Iwakami stated that as one of the primary antagonists in the series the mashup of cuteness and darkness is the central theme to Madoka and Kyubey is an epitome of that theme A central goal in Urobuchis writing was to highlight the moral and ethical dissonance between Kyubey and the young middle school girls which was done through actions such as Kyubey eating its own corpse to recycle energy He compared the character to monsters in the works of horror fiction author H P Lovecraft commenting of Kyubey he isnt evil it is his lack of feelings that make him scary Urobuchi also remarked upon the moral ambiguity the series displays in an interview with Asahi Shimbun stating AlQaeda brought down the Twin Towers due to their selfrighteousness Justice for some people is an evil for others Good intentions kindness and hope will not necessarily make people happyDue to unforeseen scheduling problems at Shaft production of the series was postponed for three years following the completion of its writing Once the issues were resolved production began without further complications The animation studio led the conception and design of the witches and created each ones individual backstory Urobuchi had originally envisioned the witches to be similar to conventional monsters such as Godzilla but upon seeing the surreal concept art for one of the main witches Walpurgisnacht he said How can Homura possibly fight against something like this Designers from Shaft added quotations from the German folklorist Faust to the series Throughout production the animation production team Gekidan Inu Curry had freedom to insert new details and to modify existing ones from the original script for example during a scene in the final episode in which the team added black wings to Homurasomething that was not included in Urobuchis writing Urobuchi praised this aspect of the production commenting additions by the animation production team added more mystery and depth to the characters and without them it would have been very difficult to write any further stories in the world of the seriesMusicIwakami and Shinbo recruited Yuki Kajiura to compose the soundtrack for the series after Urobuchi recommended her Shinbo had previously worked with Kajiura on Le Portrait de Petit Cossette Urobuchi told of the inspirational effect the music from that series had on him while writing parts of the script Urobuchi said he had long been a fan of Kajiuras anime soundtracks and  praised her work ethic saying she would always familiarize herself with the storys plotline while composing for it Japanese pop music duo ClariS was also commissioned to perform the series opening theme Connect  Konekuto Iwakami involved himself in the songs development to ensure it would fit with the series marking one of the few times he intervened in an aspect of the production Both Connect and the ending theme Magia by Kalafina were revealed in a television commercial several weeks before the series premiere in JapanBroadcast and distributionOn January   Puella Magi Madoka Magica debuted on Mainichi Broadcasting System MBS Tokyo Broadcasting System TBS and ChubuNippon Broadcasting CBC in Japan The first ten episodes aired

the  Thoku earthquake and tsunami TBS also canceled its scheduled airing of the th episode so it could provide more news coverage of the natural disasterUrobuchi apologized to viewers for the delays he also said the postponements could be viewed in a positive light because they alleviated some production pressures on animation studio Shaft because of the tight broadcast schedule Citing particularly challenging drawings for episodes  and  Urobuchi and Iwakami planned to have Shaft continue to improve the episodes up until their rescheduled broadcasts According to Urobuchi if episode  had been aired in its current state as scheduled the result would likely have been disappointing On March   the broadcast for the rest of the series was indefinitely delayed but the production team reported that they were continuing to work on the episodes and announced their intention to finish airing the series by April On April   the official website for Puella Magi Madoka Magica announced that broadcasts would resume on April  Episodes  and  aired backtoback on MBS while TBS and CBC ran episode  together with episodes  and Iwakami later commented on this unique production experience in an interview with Anime News Network He said Shaft was always pressed for time during the production process and only just completed each episode before its air time After the earthquake and tsunami he stated that many of the companys staff were upset by the incident and were unable to work effectively on episodes  and  He said however a week went by and two weeks went by and the staff started

is one of the shows most exceptional qualities and also commended the characters tragic arcparticularly Sayaka and Homura He further praised the series for offering unique grim twist that not only

backdrops shown during witch fights which he described as surreal beautiful and trippy In his review of the three bluray volumes of the anime series Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network characterized the story as very emotionally dark and one of the most ambitious and beautiful anime series in recent memory He awarded each of the volumes ratings of A or A overall and stated Time will tell us whether or not this show will be remembered as fondly as it is regarded by the fan community now but it feels like a masterpiece something to be appreciated again and again It is a mustsee for anyone

detail that makes it a uniquely pleasurable experience to watch and the main characters are well developed and its hard not to get attached to them as the story progresses Reviewers highly praised the series darker approach to the popular magical girl subgenre in Japanese anime and manga In its review of the series the staff at Japanator said this trope added a level of depth and complexity to the genre that we havent ever seen and I dont think we will see again  adding on that dressing gave the show a more perverse and cruel feeling to it making it all the more compelling to watch Liz Ohanesian of LA Weekly attributed the series popularity with older male audiencesan otherwise unusual demographic to the genreto the genre deconstruction of Puella Magi Madoka Magica She also commented on the series cultural impact writing that in Japan and the US there has been incredible fan interest for the series She credited the allstar crew including writer Urobuchi director Shinbo and the Shaft animation studio as hitmakers and described the anime as a series designed for acclaim TechnologyTells Jenni Lada wrote that the shows external appearance belied its true darker and more twisted essence She recommended viewers watch at least three episodes to discover the series true natureAccording to Sara Cleto and Erin Bah the subversion of the magical girl genre draws attention to the question of narrative powerparticularly in the use of alternative timelinesas the characters fight for their survival Production IGs Katsuyuki Motohiro watched Puella Magi Madoka Magica after hearing opinions that it exceeded Neon Genesis Evangelion Upon viewing the series he was amazed that there was a person who could write such a work and began analyzing Urobuchis other works he was motivated to ask Urobuchi to write the crime thriller PsychoPass In issue  of Neo journalist Matt Kamen wrote With its daring approach to a dated genre Puella Magi Madoka Magica essentially does for magical girls what Neon Genesis Evangelion did for giant robots Writing for Kotaku critic Richard Eisenbeis hailed the series as one of the best anime and wrote It deconstructs the magical girl genre and builds an emotional narrative filled with memorable characters Joshua Greenberg of The Daily Bruin described it as a creepy deconstructionist take on the magical girl genreSalesThe first Bluray

first volumes record Each subsequent volume sold over  copies in their first week As of October  the total sales of BD and DVDs of the series recorded  copies which was unusual for a latenight program at that time This was despite controversy over the pricing of the volumes which some considered to be unfairly high The staff at Japanator stated they could not recommend the volume to their readers
