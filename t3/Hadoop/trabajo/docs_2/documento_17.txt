defeat and reforms After the war Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for his crimes Years later Kakashi steps down while Naruto marries Hinata Hyuga and becomes the Seventh Hokage raising the next generationProductionDevelopmentIn  Shueisha released Karakuri a oneshot manga by Masashi Kishimoto that earned an honorable mention in the Hop Step Award in  Kishimoto was unsatisfied with his subsequent drafts for a followup and decided to work on another project The new project was originally going to feature Naruto as a chef but this version never made it to print Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox so he created a oneshot of Naruto for the summer  issue of Akamaru Jump based on the idea Despite the positive feedback it received in a readers poll Kishimoto was unhappy with the art and the story so he rewrote it as a story about ninjasThe first eight chapters of Naruto were planned before it appeared in Weekly Shnen Jump and these chapters originally devoted many panels of intricate art to illustrating the Konoha village By the time Naruto debuted the background art was sparse instead emphasizing the characters Though Kishimoto had concerns that chakra the energy source used by the ninjas in Naruto made the series too Japanese he still believed it is an enjoyable read Kishimoto is a fan of Godzilla and the tailed beasts mythology was introduced because Kishimoto wanted an excuse to draw monsters  He has said that the central theme in Part I of Naruto is how people accept each other citing Narutos development across the series as an exampleFor Part II of the manga Kishimoto tried to keep the panel layouts and the plot easy for the reader to follow and avoid overdoing the typical mangastyle  He considers that his drawing style has changed from the classic manga look to something a bit more realistic Because of wishing to end the arc involving Sasuke Uchihas search for his brother Itachi in a single volume Kishimoto decided that volume  should include more chapters than regular volumes As a result Kishimoto apologized to readers for this since volume  was more expensive than regular volumesCharactersWhen he created Naruto Kishimoto looked to other shnen manga as influences for his work and tried to make his characters unique while basing the story on Japanese culture The separation of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a particular flavor Kishimoto wanted each member to have a high level of aptitude in one skill and be talentless in another He found it difficult to write about romance but emphasized it more in Part II of the manga beginning with volume  He introduced villains into the story to have them act as a counterpoint to his characters moral values and clearly illustrate their differences As a result of how the younger characters were significantly weaker than the villains Kishimoto made the ellipsis in order to have them age and become stronger during this timeSettingKishimoto made use of the Chinese zodiac tradition which had a longstanding presence in Japan the zodiac hand signs originate from this When Kishimoto was creating the primary setting of the Naruto manga he concentrated initially on the designs for the village of Konoha The idea of the setting came to him pretty spontaneously without much thought but admits that the scenery became based on his home in the Japanese prefecture of Okayama Since the storyline does not specify when it is set he was able to include modern elements in the series such as convenience stores He considered including automobiles planes and simple computers but excluded projectile weapons and vehicles from the plotConclusionMasashi Kishimotos home was close to Hiroshima where his grandfather lived He would often tell his grandson stories of war and how it was related to grudges In retrospect Kishimoto commented he could not criticize anyone as a result of the war based on it was built Upon further researching Kishimoto decided to create world war story arc for the mangas finale However unlike the stories he heard from his grandfather Kishimoto wanted to give the war covered in Naruto a more hopeful feeling Nagatos arc paved the way for the ending of Naruto to occur Nagato stood out as a villain due to suffering war and killing Narutos mentor Jiraiya Understanding the fears of war Narutos characterization was made more complex for him to experience the Fourth Great Shinobi War These events end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato in the final battleDue to unknown issues the series finale was delayed Once volume  was released Kishimoto commented he reached a moment from the narrative involving something he always wanted to draw When serialization began Kishimoto decided the ending would feature a fight between two characters Naruto and Sasuke However the writer felt the two were not equals as the former was not a victim of war like the latter whose family was killed to stop a possible civil warKishimoto chose Hinata Hyuga as Narutos romantic partner from the early stages of the manga since Hinata had always respected and admired Naruto even before the series beginning and Kishimoto felt this meant the two of them could build a relationship When Hinata first appeared Kishimoto thought of expanding romantic plotlines but decided to leave Narutos maturation through romance as an idea for the film  The Last Naruto the Movie where he worked alongside screenwriter Maruo Kyozuka a writer more skilled at the theme of romance Similarly the title characters relationship with his first son Boruto was explored furthermore in the  film Boruto Naruto the Movie to end Narutos growth as the character had become an adult but it was briefly shown in the mangas finaleMediaMangaWritten and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto Naruto was serialized for a year run in Shueishas magazine Weekly Shnen Jump from

Responding to Narutos success Kishimoto said in Naruto Collector Winter  that he was very glad that the American audience has accepted and understood ninja It shows that the American audience has good taste  because it means they can accept something previously unfamiliar to themSeveral reviewers commented on the balance between fight scenes and plot development A E Sparrow of IGN and Casey Brienza of Anime News Network felt that the result was a strong storyline but Carl Kimlinger also writing for the same website suggested that there were too many fights which slowed down the plot Kimlinger liked the character designs and approved of the fight scenes themselves which also drew positive comments from Rik Spanjers who felt that the excitement of the scenes depends on Kishimotos skill in depicting action Javier Lugo writing for Manga Life agreed describing the artwork as dramatic exciting and just right for the story hes telling Briana Lawrence from Mania Entertainment describes the growth of the characters gave Part II an adult feel In a review of volume  Brienza also praised Part IIs storyline and characterization though she commented that not every volume reached a high level of quality The fights across the Part II received praise most notably Narutos and Sasukes resulting in major changes into their character arcs Meanwhile the final battle between the two characters in the finale earned major praise for the choreography and art provided as well as how in depth the twos personalities were shown in the aftermath Some writers criticized Kaguya being the least entertaining villain making the showdown between Naruto and Sasuke more appealing as a result The finale earned nearly perfect scores from both Anime News Network and Comic Book Bin with the latter acclaiming the popularity of the title characterG It a professor in the manga department of Tokyo Polytechnic University compared the series development to the manga of Dragon Ball saying that both manga present good illustrations of threedimensional body movements that capture the characters martial arts very well G felt readers could empathize with the characters in Naruto via their inner monologue during battles The series also influenced the movie Scott Pilgrim vs The World with director Edgar Wright saying he was inspired by how whenever there is a killer move in the manga there is an impact in the background following any techniques usage When the manga ended multiple authors from the magazine expressed congratulations to Kishimotos work The fight scenes in general earned acclaim for how well written they are something game developer CyberConnect took into account when developing the Naruto games Christel Hoolans managing director director of Kana and Le Lombard called Naruto the first longrunning series after Dragon Ball to become a classic in FranceThemesAmy Plumb argues that Kishimotos use of references to Japanese mythology in Naruto is intended to add further layers to the story Kishimoto expects his readers to decode the references which allows him to avoid direct explanations One example is Itachi who has three ninja techniques named after Shinto deities Tsukiyomi Amaterasu and Susanoo Plumb also cites Sasukes clans heraldic symbol a fan known as an uchiwa These fans are used in Japanese myths to exorcise evil by blowing it away Sasuke discovers late in the series that he has the ability to blow away the influence of the NineTailed Fox on Naruto Foxes kitsune tsuki are tricksters in Japanese mythology and in some stories they take over human bodies Plumb comments on the obvious similarities to the NineTail sealed in Naruto and the pranks Naruto playsChristopher A Born notes that the Naruto storyline contains traditional Confucian values and suggests that students who analyse manga such as Naruto and Bleach will learn more about Confucianism than they would from studying its abstract ideas Norman Melchor Robles Jr evaluated the portrayal of both positive and negative ideas in Naruto by counting words in the script which were associated with either violence or positive values he found that a small majority of tagged words were violent but commented that the portrayal of violence seemed organized to show how positive strategies on the part of the protagonists could overcome the violence Sheuo Hui Gan considers the series to have a set of traditional ethical values She also compares the treatment of alienation in Naruto which Naruto overcomes by joining his society to the portrayal of alienation in Akira and Neon Genesis Evangelion where the main characters remain alienatedNaruto has been described by several critics as a comingofage story Psychologist Lawrence C Rubin suggests that the storylines would appeal to readers of any age who have lost loved ones or are having difficulty finding friends or who are in other situations shown in the series  In Yukari Fujimotos view as the characters mature they show respect to the adults who have raised and taught them making it a conservative storyline in comparison to other manga of the same time period such as One Piece and Air Gear  Rik Spanjers sees the difference between Sasuke a loner and Naruto an optimist as tragic arguing that the contrast between the two protagonists approach to the world is fundamental to the plot Narutos strength grows as he gains more loved ones to protect while Sasuke remains alone and is increasingly absorbed by his quest for revenge  Omote Tomoyuki points out that there are many comic moments in the story despite the difficulties Naruto finds himself in but the comic elements diminish dramatically over time as Naruto grows into a teenager particularly once Part II begins Shnen Jump began to carry comedies such as Gintama and Reborn from  onwards and in Tomoyukis view this is part of the reason for the change in emphasis Naruto was not supposed to provide laughter anymoreFujimoto argues that the story has overly traditional gender roles noting  its representations suggest that men are men and women are women and that they differ naturally regarding aptitude and vocation For example the girls initially outperform the boys in the Ninja Academy but once the boys get serious the girls cannot keep pace Fujimoto points out that this does not upset Sakura who is now surpassed by Naruto Character development based on female roles when it does occur again uses stereotypical roles Tsunade for example a middleaged woman with large breasts is a clear mother figure and when she teaches Sakura to be a medical ninja which requires special skills possessed only by women the story reinforces the idea that women only belong on the battlefield as healers Tsunade herself who is a figure of authority in Naruto is portrayed as ridiculous in a way that men in the same position are not Fujimoto suggests this presentation of women may explain why the female characters are often the most disliked characters among readers of the mangaNaruto runThe Naruto run or ninja run is a running style based on the way the characters run leaning forward with their arms outstretched behind their backs It became popular in  when groups worldwide organized events to run like Naruto characters especially on anniversaries of the series On June   Matty Roberts posted a satirical event called Storm Area  They Cant Stop All of Us on Facebook where he wrote We will all meet up at the Area  Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry If we naruto run we can move faster than their bullets Lets see them aliens This quickly became an Internet meme resulting in nationwide alerts and warnings issued by Nevada law enforcement and the US Air Force to not go to Area
