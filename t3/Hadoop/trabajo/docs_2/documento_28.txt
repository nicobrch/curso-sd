into trouble by participating in the One Outs game where a pitcher and batter duel on with money on the line The next day Kojima arrives to avenge his teammates and meets Ta Tokuchi who appears to have no special pitching skills but defeats Kojima easily and causes him to enter seclusion to reevaluate himself as a professional player Later Tokuchi accepts a rematch after Kojima raised the stakes proclaiming he will retire immediately if he loses but he will take Tokuchis right arm to make sure he will never gamble on baseball again if Tokuchi loses This time Tokuchi experiences his very first loss and offers Kojima his right arm to have it broken Instead Kojima tells him he never intended to break it and asks Tokuchi to join the Lycaons and use his unique pitching ability to take the Lycaons to the championship Soon Tokuchi meets Saikawa the greedy owner of the Lycaons who only cares about the team making a profit Saikawa is reluctant to give Tokuchi any sort of significant salary due to his inexperience as a professional but Tokuchi offers an unusual proposal He proposes the One Outs contract a performancebased pay where he gets  yen for every out he pitches but loses  for every run he gives upLater on in the baseball season it is revealed that even the One Outs contract was done for the benefit of the team as Saikawa had no plans to keep the Lycaons and set up a deal to sell the team to the Tronpos company Knowing this Tokuchi formed an alliance with Tronpos and provided financial intel on Saikawa in exchange for financial backing With this intel Tronpos is able to make sure they are able to purchase the Lycaons as cheaply as possible by spreading rumors to dissuade other corporations from bidding Unfortunately for the Lycaons Tronpos also has no plans on proceeding with the current lineup and will replace all players after purchasing them The Tronpos chairman made a mistake by believing Tokuchi to be his supporter and told Tokuchi his intended bid to which Tokuchi responded with a last minute counterofferFor triple the bid Tokuchi becomes the new owner of the Lycaons Though there is heavy dissent in the team due to his dubious nature Tokuchi starts to implement a wide variety of changes most notably the LTicket It is the old admission ticket with a new  admission fee but with the promise of a full refund if the Lycaons loses the game Additionally the spectators can make up to five votes for the MVP on the ticket which will directly influence the new player salaries by paying  yen per vote Though the Lycaons are in chaos with the new changes the team slowly realizes that these changes are what the team needs in order to become strong enough to win the championshipCharactersMain charactersToa Tokuchi   Tokuchi
