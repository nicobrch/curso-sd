broadcastingKazuhiko Torishima Akira Toriyamas editor for Dr Slump and the first half of Dragon Ball felt that the Dragon Ball animes ratings were gradually declining because it had the same producer that worked on Dr Slump Torishima said this producer had this cute and funny image connected to Toriyamas work and was missing the more serious tone in the newer series and therefore asked the studio to change the producer Impressed with their work on Saint Seiya he asked its director Kz Morishita and writer Takao Koyama to help reboot Dragon Ball which coincided with Goku growing up The new producer explained that ending the first anime and creating a new one would result in more promotional money and the result was the start of Dragon Ball Z The title was suggested by Toriyama because Z is the last letter of the alphabet and he wanted to finish the series because he was running out of ideas for it Ironically enough the sequel series would end up producing more episodes than its predecessorDragon Ball Z is adapted from the final  chapters of the manga series which were published in Weekly Shnen Jump from  to  It premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on April   taking over its predecessors time slot and ran for  episodes until its conclusion on January   Because Toriyama was writing the manga during the production of the anime Dragon Ball Z added original material not adapted from the manga including lengthening scenes or adding new ones and adding new attacks and characters not present in the manga For example Toriyama was asked to create an additional character for Gokus training with King Kai resulting in the cricket GregoryThroughout the production the voice actors were tasked with playing different characters and performing their lines on cue switching between roles as necessary The voice actors were unable to record the lines separately because of the close dialogue timing When asked if juggling the different voices of Goku Gohan and Goten were difficult Masako Nozawa said that it was not and that she was able to switch roles simply upon seeing the characters picture She did admit that when they were producing two films a year and television specials in addition to the regular series there were times when they had only line art to look at while recording which made giving finer nuanced details in her performance difficultOne of the character designers for Dragon Ball Z was Tadayoshi Yamamuro He was responsible for designing and animating Gokus Super Saiyan form in the series He used the martial artist Bruce Lee as a reference for Gokus Super Saiyan form stating that when he first becomes a Super Saiyan his slanting pose with that scowling look in his eyes is all Bruce Lee In the original manga itself Gokus piercing eyes in Super Saiyan form were also based on Bruce Lees paralyzing glareEnglish dub production and broadcastingIn  Funimation Productions now known as Crunchyroll LLC licensed Dragon Ball Z for an Englishlanguage release in North America after cancelling their initial dub of Dragon Ball halfway through their originallyplanned episode first season Funimations  release was not the first broadcast

musicians for Saban Ron Wasserman and Jeremy Sweet known for their work on the Power Rangers franchise composed a new guitardriven background score and theme song nicknamed Rock the Dragon Funimations initial English dub of Dragon Ball Z had mandated cuts to content and length which reduced the first  episodes into  though TV episode  actually ends halfway through uncut episode  Most of the edits were done to make the anime more tame and kidfriendly most notably having references to death sidestepped with phrases like sent to the next dimension It premiered in the United States on September   in firstrun syndication but halted production in  after two seasons despite strong ratings This was due to Saban scaling down its syndication operations in order to focus on producing original material for the Fox Kids Network and its newly acquired Fox Family Channel Pioneer also ceased its home video release of the series at volume  the end of the dub and retained the rights to produce an uncut subtitled version but did not do so They did however release uncut dubs of the first three Z movies on home videoOn August   reruns of this canceled dub began airing on Cartoon Network as part

However they also replaced the original Vancouverbased cast with an inhouse voice cast at their Texasbased studio with the goal of the new voices sounding similar to the Vancouver cast The Sabanproduced soundtrack from the first two seasons was replaced with a new background score composed by Bruce Faulconer and his team of musicians which was used throughout the rest of Funimations Dragon Ball Z dub This renewed dub featured less censorship due to both Sabans absence and fewer restrictions on cable programming and aired new episodes on Cartoon Networks Toonami block from

and corrections of the original work The original footage was remastered for HDTV featuring updated opening and ending sequences new music and a rerecording of the vocal tracks The original material and any damaged frames were removed along with the majority of the filler episodes to more closely follow the manga resulting in a fastermoving story Torishima later explained the origins of Kai Bandai was having a hard time increasing their sales and asked if a new Dragon Ball anime could be made but Toriyama refused to create a new story Realizing that the animeexclusive scenes that were added to increase the distance between the original anime and the manga hurt the pacing of the series Torishima thought of cutting them so that it faithfully followed the manga He said the reception to Kai was positive so it all worked outThe series initially concluded on its th episode in Japan on March   with the finale of the Cell saga It was originally planned to run  episodes however due to

Dragon Ball SuperAn alternate English dub of Kai by Ocean Productions was recorded for the original  episodes featuring many of the original Vancouver cast reprising their roles but it has yet to airEditingDragon Ball Zs original North American release was the subject of heavy editing which resulted in a large amount of removed content and alterations that greatly changed the original work Funimation CEO Gen Fukunaga is often criticized for his role in the editing but it was the initial distributor Saban which required such changes or they would not air the work as was the case with the episode dealing with orphans These changes included altering every aspect of the show from character names clothing scenes and dialogue of the show The character Mr Satan was renamed Hercule and this change has been retained in other English media such as Vizs Dragon Ball Z manga and video games though the English dubs of Dragon Ball Kai and Dragon Ball Super changed the name back to Mr Satan The dialogue changes would sometimes contradict the scenes itself after the apparent fatal explosion of a helicopter one of the characters said I can see their parachutes theyre okay Funimations redub for the  release would address many of the issues raised by Saban with the uncut releases preserving the integrity of the original Japanese releaseDuring the original Japanese TV airing of Dragon Ball Kai scenes involving blood and brief nudity were removed Nicktoons would also alter Kai for its broadcast it released a preview showcasing these changes which included removing the blood and cheek scar from Bardock and altering the color of Master Roshis alcohol The show was further edited for its broadcast on The CW most notoriously the character Mr Popo was tinted blue The shows DVD and Bluray releases only contained the edits present in the original Japanese version A rumor that Cartoon Network would be airing Kai uncut was met with an official statement to debunk the rumor in June  However it would later air uncut on the channel as part of Adult Swims Toonami blockSteven Simmons who did the subtitling for Funimations home video releases offered commentary on the subtitling from a project and technical standpoint addressing several concerns Simmons said that Gen Fukunaga did not want any swearing on the discs but because there was no taboo word list Simmons would substitute a variation in the strength of the words by situation with the changes starting in episode  The typographical errors in the script were caused by dashes  and doublequotes  failing to appear which resulted in confusing dialogueMusicDragon Ball Z has released a series of  soundtracks as part of the Dragon Ball Z Hit Song Collection Series In total dozens of releases exist for Dragon Ball Z which

and would frequently make Billboard rankings as separate entries Home release sales were featured prominently on the Nielsen VideoScan charts Further complicating the release of the material was
