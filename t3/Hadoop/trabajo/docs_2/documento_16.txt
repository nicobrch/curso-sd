to stalk him Finding Haruko weaseling her way into his life as a livein maid Naota discovers that the head injury she caused created an NO portal which giant robots produced by a company known as Medical Mechanica emerge from periodically The first of these robots is hit on the head by Haruko and becomes a friendly service robot later named Canti Canti ingests Naota to assume the reddened form he first had when fighting the robots sent after himHaruko claims she is an alien investigator from the Galactic Space Police Brotherhood and her presence places Naota and those around him in danger The Interstellar Immigration Bureaus Commander Amarao whom Haruko has a history with asserts rather that she is an apathetic seductress seeking a spacemanipulating being called Atomsk who was partially contained within Canti Every time Naota is absorbed by Canti Atomsk is gradually brought to Earth As Atomsk is held in Medical Mechanicas custody and Haruko ultimately places Earth under threat the company eventually turns their factory stationed on the planet into a doomsday terraforming device attempting to have Naota and Canti absorbed by the doomsday devices Terminal Core Harukos plan fails as Naota ends up becoming Atomsks host and then releases him into the universe after a brief battle that ends Medical Mechanicas attack on Earth Haruko follows after Atomsk and Mabase

sometime in between these events Placing herself as a middle school homeroom teacher Haruko targets a yearold girl named Hidomi Hibajiri through her classmate and eventual love interest Ko Ide Haruko finds opposition in both the headphones Hidomi wears and Julia Jinyu a more stoic offshoot of Haruko that splintered from her during her initial attempt to control Atomsks power Haruko eventually eats Julia to restore herself and uses Ide to get to Hidomi Like before this causes conflict between Medical Mechanica and the Interstellar Immigration Bureau as the latter was reverseengineering Cantis technology to utilize the NO channels energies for their own use Atomsk appears on Earth as planned but Haruko ends up failing again with a freed Julia taking her leave Haruko regains her composure and resumes her hunt for Atomsk as Hidomi and Ide begin their relationship while Mabase rebuilds after much of it was destroyed by Medical MechanicaIn the third season FLCL Alternative Haruko enters the life of high school student Kana Koumoto and her friends as she became a mentor of sorts to Kana in helping the teens transition into adulthood as Medical Mechanica begins its assault on Earth While helping Kana resolve some issues as one of her friends leaves for Mars Haruko ends up on another planet as a direct result of Kanas reverse NO portal that they used to transport Medical Mechanicas plants off the planet The season takes place before the events of all the other seasons currently presentIn the fourth season FLCL Grunge Haruko manipulates the mobrun town of Okura in a scheme to infect Medical Mechanica with a virus and steal Atomsk from them In the process she influences the lives of three working kids Shinpachi Shonari and Orinoko before taking off after Atomsk on top of Medical Mechanicas plant The season takes place between the events of Shoegaze and the first seasonIn the fifth season FLCL Shoegaze Masaki is a teenager who sees ghosts that nobody else can

now a yearold adult working for the bureau and is called in to assist in getting the teenagers out After setting off an explosion the teenagers find that the tower extends into NO space The bureau chief admits that the purpose of the tower is to reconnect the dimension they are currently in with a separate one that split away  years ago and he hopes that with enough emotional turmoil he can get Masaki to trigger the NO device and merge them back together After Harumi is shot and Masaki realizes that he loves her his NO field begins the merger in which Harumi realizes that she is actually from the other dimension a colony on Mars As Masaki calms the merger fails and a large snakelike entity appears In the closing credits Masaki is able to jump dimensions through NO space to visit the Mars colony He explains that the wormcreature helps him do so and its name is AtomskProductionThe first season of FLCL was directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki and produced by the FLCL Production Committee which included Gainax Production IG and Starchild RecordsTsurumaki has said that he tried to break the rules of anime when making FLCL for example by choosing a contemporary Japanese band to provide the soundtrack and patterning the style more after a Japanese TV commercial or promotional video creating a work that is short but densepackedFLCLs localization director and script writer Marc Handler stated that localization of the script was the hardest part of the show The injokes in the show included obscure pop culture references that had to be decoded and transferred to English audiences One example was a reference to Cheerio a discontinued soft drink in Japan for the English release the choice was made to use a discontinued American soft drink at the time Crystal Pepsi Director Kazuya Tsurumaki responded to criticism of FLCL stating comprehension should not be an important factor in FLCLThe Medical Mechanica building featured is in the shape of a large iron The character Amarao describes Medical Mechanicas goal as the destruction of all thought FLCL uses the iron as a symbolic breakdown of thought by smoothing out the wrinkles as equated to the removing of the brains wrinkles For English localization the Japanese team had to explain the concept because a direct translation of script did not convey the ideologyMediaOriginal video animationThe sixepisode series was

citing the packaging of  episodes per DVD as the only weakness of SynchPoints original release Robert Nelson of THEM Anime Reviews gave the anime  out of  stars stating FLCL may not have a straightforward or deep plot It may not have complex characterizations Hell it may not have any meaning But FLCL does succeed in its true objective It is fun to watch Chris Beveridge of Mania gave it an A stating FLCL is something that allowed those involved to try a wide variety of styles and techniques and does come off as quite experimental But nearly everything worked in their favor and you end up with three hours of nearly break neck speed action comedy and commentary on modern life Brian Ruh praised the series stating It was very frenetic and kept pushing the envelope on what was possible in Japanese animationIGN columnist Davis Smith reviewed the anime shortly after its English premiere In the article Smith praised the series unusual story telling extremely high quality animation and the soundtrack provided by the Pillows rewarding the series a score of  out of  concluding Logic dictates that FLCL should be an undisciplined and unaffecting mess given all the insanity that its creators are attempting to weld into a functioning whole Yet while its hard to explain exactly why it works It entertains me At times it makes me laugh at times it makes me a little mistyeyed at times it makes me want to scream and howl and light things on fire and break windows with baseball bats and yes maybe even buy a Vespa Thats the kind of success that you just cant argue withFrom

season a series that was heavily influenced by FLCLs animation style In the article Childs gave an extremely positive review of the series understanding it as a surrealist inspired coming of age story stating For all of its wild and initially bewildering aspects the major purpose of FLCL is the impressionistic and often naturalistic documentation of Naotas passage into maturityAvatar The Last Airbender director Giancarlo Volpe has stated members of his staff were all ordered to buy FLCL and watch every single episode of itChainsaw Man creator Tatsuki Fujimoto has stated in his  million
