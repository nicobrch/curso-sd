visible emotion for the first time frustrated and confused and attempts to hide herself from the worldLN  With her Ether coming loose again Sora and Shiro watch her past through her ebbing powers they convince her that she is not actually the god of doubt proclaiming her instead the God of Wisdom and naming her Holou from hollow a pun on their own names and of BlankLN  Finally accepting herself and her lack of knowledge she joins Elkia and makes amends with the Shrine Maiden she intends to cooperate with Sora and Shiros plan to make her into both an idol and the selfdeclared representative of the Old Deus She then declares her intentions directly to Tet who thanks her for being born her being the creator of Schwis race but he also makes her properly angry for the first time by defeating
