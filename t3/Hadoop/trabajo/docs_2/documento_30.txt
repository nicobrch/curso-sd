horizontal plane of the rim and scores by shoving the ball directly through the basket with one or both hands It is a type of field goal that is worth two points Such a shot was known as a dunk shot until the term slam dunk was coined by former Los Angeles Lakers announcer Chick HearnThe slam dunk is usually the highest percentage shot and a crowdpleaser Thus the maneuver is often taken from the basketball game and showcased in slam dunk contests such as the NBA Slam Dunk Contest held during the annual NBA AllStar Weekend The first incarnation of the NBA Slam Dunk Contest was held during the halftime of the  ABA AllStar GameA study was carried out in  to show the effectiveness of different shot types including slam dunks The study was carried out across five different levels of basketball NBA EuroBasket the Slovenian st Division and two minor leagues Overall the study showed that slam dunks were a very effective way of scoring in the game of basketball particularly in the NBA which had the highest dunk percentage in the studyHistoryJoe Fortenberry playing for the McPherson Globe Refiners dunked the ball in  in Madison Square Garden The feat was immortalized by Arthur Daley Pulitzer Prize winning sports writer for The New York Times in an article in March  He wrote that Joe Fortenberry and his teammate Willard Schmidt instead of shooting up for a layup leaped up and pitched the ball downward into the hoop much like a cafeteria customer dunking a roll in coffeeDuring the s foot center and Olympic gold medalist Bob Kurland was dunking regularly during games Yet defenders viewed the execution of a slam dunk as a personal affront that deserved retribution thus defenders often intimidated offensive players and thwarted the move Kurlands rival big man George Mikan noted  We used to dunk in pregame practice not in the game Satch Sanders a career Boston Celtic from  to  said in the old days defenders would run under you when you were in the air trying to take people out of games so they couldnt play It was an unwritten ruleStill by the s and early s some of the NBAs tallest and strongest centers such as Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain had incorporated the move into their offensive arsenal  Slightly smaller players at forward and guard then began to dunk helping to popularize the move like Jumping Johnny Green Gus Johnson  Elgin Baylor and Connie Hawkins in the s and David Thompson and Julius Erving in the s This transformed dunking into the standard fare it is today rule changesIn the s Jim Pollard and Wilt Chamberlain had both dunked from the free throw line feet from the basket Chamberlain was able to dunk from the freethrow line without a running start beginning his forward movement from within the top half of the freethrow circle This was the catalyst for the  NCAA rule change which requires that a shooter maintain both feet behind the line during a freethrow attempt  An inbounds pass over the backboard was also banned because of Chamberlain  Offensive goaltending also called basket interference was introduced as a rule in  after Bill Russell had exploited it at San Francisco and Chamberlain was soon to enter college play While at the University of Kansas Chamberlain was known to have dunked on an experimental foot basket set up by Phog Allen When Chamberlain dunked the ball it was called a dipper dunkLew Alcindor ruleDunking was banned in the NCAA and high school sports from  to  Many people have attributed the ban to the dominance of the college phenomenon Lew Alcindor now known as Kareem AbdulJabbar the nodunking rule is sometimes referred to as the Lew Alcindor rule Others have attributed the ban to racial motivations as at the time most of the prominent dunkers in college basketball were AfricanAmerican and the ban took place less than a year after the  NCAA University Division basketball championship game wherein a Texas Western team with an allblack starting lineup beat an allwhite Kentucky team to win the national championship Under head coach Guy Lewis Houston with Elvin Hayes made considerable use of the stuff shot on their way to the Final Four in Breakaway rimsIn the NBA in  Arthur Erhat filed a patent for a rim that had give but immediately returned to its original position making dunking safe for the first time by significantly reducing the shattering of backboards   In  Ervings teammate and center Darryl Dawkins twice shattered NBA backboards with dunks leading to a quicklyenacted rule making it an offence to break the backboard Technology has evolved to adapt to the increased strength and weight of players to withstand the force of such dunks such as the breakaway rim introduced to the NBA in  changes to the material used for the backboards and strengthening of the goal standards themselves The invention by Arthur Ehrat to create the breakaway rim with a spring on it led to the return of the dunk in college basketballAllstar power forward Gus Johnson of the Baltimore Bullets was the first of the famous backboard breakers in the NBA shattering three during his career in the s and early s Luke Jackson also shattered a backboard in  In the ABA Charlie Hentz broke two backboards in the same game on  November  resulting in the game being calledThe NBA has made shattering the backboard a technical foul although it will not count towards a players count of seven that can draw a suspension or two towards ejection from a game and it counts towards a players count of six personal fouls This has assisted in deterring this action as it can cost the team pointsSlam Dunk Contest eraThe firstever Slam Dunk Contest was held on January   at McNichols Sports Arena in Denver during halftime of the  ABA AllStar Game the leagues final AllStar game before the completion of the ABANBA merger Erving defeated Thompson in the championship round after leaping from the freethrow line The other participants were Artis Gilmore George Gervin and Larry Kenon The NBA held its first Slam Dunk Contest as a oneoff seasonlong event similar to NBA Horse event held the following season During halftime at each game there was a oneonone slam dunk competition Former ABA player Darnell Dr Dunk Hillman was named the winner that season Although he received the winners  check Hillman did not receive a trophy until Modern eraThe Houston Cougars from  to  with Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler were known as Phi Slama Jama The national champion  North Carolina Tar Heels also featured two notable dunkers James Worthy and Michael JordanLarry Nance won the first modern dunk contest in  Spud Webb at  ft  in  m defeated  ft  in  m Dominique Wilkins in the  dunk contest  Michael Jordan nicknamed Air Jordan for his dunking ability popularized a dunk referred to by some fans as the Leaner in  contest This dunk was so called because Jordans body was not perpendicular to the ground while performing the dunk TNT viewers rated it the best dunk of all time over Vince Carters betweenthelegs slam In the  NBA Slam Dunk Contest which came down to Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins Jordan dunked from the freethrow line much like Erving but parted his legs making his dunk arguably more memorable than Ervings Twice in his rookie season  during games center Shaquille ONeal dunked so hard that he broke the hydraulic support of one goal standard against the Phoenix Suns and broke the welds holding up another goal standard causing the basket to break off and fall to the floor against the New Jersey Nets although in neither case did the glass break This resulted in reinforced backboard supports as well During that same season New Jerseys Chris Morris shattered a backboard in a game against the Chicago Bulls the most recent shatteredbackboard incident in the NBA to dateIn the  NBA Slam Dunk Contest winner Brent Barry dunked from the freethrow line Barry received  out of  for the dunk Kobe Bryant won the  Dunk ContestpresentVince Carter dunked while leaping over foot  m French center Frdric Weis in the  Summer Olympics The French media dubbed it le dunk de la mort  the dunk of death In the  dunk contest Carter used an elbow hang along with his reverse  windmill dunk reminiscent of Kenny Walkers  windmill dunk in  except that Carter spins clockwise whereas Walker spins counterclockwise and betweenthelegs dunk When performed much of the audience was speechless including the judges because none had seen these types of dunks beforeIn the  Sprite Rising Stars Slam Dunk Contest Dwight Howard performed the Superman dunk He donned a Superman outfit as Orlando Magic guard Jameer Nelson tied a cape around his shoulders Nelson alleyooped the basketball as Howard jumped from within the key side of the free throw circle line caught the ball and threw it through the rim This dunk is somewhat controversial as his hand was not over as well as on a vertical plane to the rim Some insist that it should in fact be considered a dunk because the ball was thrust downward into the basket meeting the basic definition of the dunkDuring the  NBA dunk contest Howard had a separate goal brought onto the court and the rim was noticeably significantly higher than a standard goal Howard after going into a sera telephone booth and again fashioning the Superman attire caught a pass from Nelson and easily completed a twohanded dunk on the higher goal While this was not performed for recordsetting purposes the dunk received a perfect score and a warm response from the crowd in part because of its theatrics Also in this contest  guard Nate Robinson wore a green New York Knicks jersey and green sneakers to represent Kryptonite playing on Howards Superman theme He used a green Kryptonite ball and jumped over the  Howard prior to dunking This dunk and the theatrics could have won the competition for Robinson who was voted the winner by the NBA fans Robinson then thanked Howard for graciously allowing him to dunk over him asking the crowd to also give Howard a round of applauseThe Clippers were known as Lob City in  with Chris Paul Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan and all the alleyoopsJaVale McGee currently holds the world record for Most Basketball Dunks in a Single Jump three While competing in the  NBA Sprite Slam Dunk Contest McGee jumped with two balls in his possession and dunked each prior to receiving and slamming an alleyoop pass from then teammate John WallIn the  NBA Slam Dunk Contest Zach LaVine dunked from the free throw line on three occasions One Hand Windmill and Between the Legs All of the Dunks received a score of  for the dunk and won the Dunk contestDunk typesDunk types reflect the various motions performed on the way to the basket They start with the basic one or twohand forwardfacing dunk and go on through various levels of athleticism and intricacy Discrete dunk types can be modified by appending other moves for example a player who passes the ball off the backboard catches it in the air and executes a doublepump dunk would be said to have completed a selfpass off the backboard double pumpTomahawkOne of the simplest dunk types is the tomahawk dunk resembling the windup and sharp downward motion of a blow with a tomahawk A Tomahawk dunk can be performed with one or two hands and when two hands are used it is called a backscratcher Initially referred to as a gorilla dunk that term is uncommon now During the jump the ball is raised above and often behind the players head for a windup before slamming the ball down into the net at the apex of the jump Due to the undemanding body mechanics involved in execution the tomahawk is employed by players of all sizes and jumping abilities Because of the ballsecurity provided by the use of both hands the twohanded tomahawk is a staple of game situationsfrequently employed in alleyoops and in offenserebound putback dunksIn one common variation a  spin may be completed prior to or simultaneously with the tomahawk Circa  independent slam dunker Troy McCray pioneered an especially complex variant of the dunk once the tomahawk motion is complete instead of slamming the ball in the rim a windmill dunk see below is then performedWindmillBefore takeoff or at the onset of the jump the ball is brought to the abdomen and then the windmill motion is started by moving the ball below the waist according to the length of the players fully extended arm Then following the rotation of the outstretch arm the ball is moved in a circular motion typically moving from the front towards the back and then slammed through the rim Although due to momentum many players are unable to palm the ball through the entire windmill motion the dunk is often completed with onehand as centripetal force allows the player to guide the ball with only their dunking hand In some instances sticky resins or powders may be applied to the palm these are thought to improve grip and prevent loss of possession Amongst players subtle variations in the direction of the windmill depend on bodily orientation at takeoff and also jumping style onefoot or twofeet in relation to dominant handThere are a number of variations on the windmill the most common being the aforementioned one or twohand variants In these cases the windmill motion may be performed with the previously discussed onearm technique and finished with one or twohands or the player may control the ball with two hands with both arms performing the windmill motion finishing with one or both hands Additionally the ball may be cuffed between the hand and the forearmgenerally with the dominant hand The cuff technique provides better ball security allowing for a faster windmill motion and increased force exerted on the basket at finish with either one or both hands Using the cuffing method players are also afforded the opportunity of performing the windmill motion towards the front a technique exploited by French athlete Kadour Ziani when he pioneered his trademark doublewindmillOccasionally in the game setting the windmill is performed via alleyoop but is rarely seen in offenserebound putback dunks due to the airtime required Dominique Wilkins popularized powerful windmillsin games as well as in contestsincluding twohanded selfpass  rimhang and combined variants thereofDouble ClutchAt the onset of the jump the ball is controlled by either one or both hands and once in the air is typically brought to chest level The player will then quickly thrust the ball downwards and fully extend their arms bringing the ball below the waist Finally the ball is brought above the head and dunked with one or both hands and the double clutch appears as one fluid motion As a demonstration of athletic prowess the ball may be held in the belowthewaist position for milliseconds longer thus showcasing the players hang time jumping abilityWhether the result of a  spin or body angle at takeoff the double clutch is generally performed with the players back toward the rim While this orientation is rather conducive to the double clutch motion Spud Webb was known to perform this dunk while facing the basket Additionally Kenny Sky Walker Tracy McGradyin the  and  NBA Contests respectivelyand others have performed  variation of the double clutch McGrady completed a lob selfpass before the dunk Circa  independent slam dunker TDub performed the double clutch with a  spin which he concluded by hanging on the rimBetween the LegsFor onefooted jumpers the ball is generally transferred to the nondominant hand just before or upon takeoff for twofooters this transfer is often delayed for milliseconds as both hands control the ball to prevent dropping it Once airborne the dunker generally transfers the ball from nondominant to dominant hand beneath a raised leg Finally the ball is brought upwards by the dominant hand and slammed through the rimThe betweenthelegs dunk was popularized by Isaiah Rider in the  NBA slam dunk contest who called it The East Bay Funk Dunk so much so that the dunk is often colloquially referred to as a Rider dunk  notwithstanding Orlando Woolridges own such dunk in the NBA contest a decade earlier Since then the undertheleg has been attempted in the NBA contest by a number of participants and has been a staple of other contests as well Its difficulty  due to the required handeye coordination flexibility and hangtime  keeps it generally reserved for exhibitions and contests not competitive games Ricky Davis has managed to complete the dunk in an NBA game but both he and Josh Smith have botched at least one ingame attempt as wellBecause of the possible combinations of starting and finishing hands and raisedlegs there are many variations on the basic underthelegs dunkmore so than any other For example in a  French Dunk contest Dali Taamallah leapt with his right leg while controlling the ball with his left hand and once airborne he transferred the ball from his left hand underneath his right leg to his right hand before completing the dunk NBA star Jason Richardson has also pioneered several notable variations of the betweenthelegs including a lobpass to himself and a pass off of the backboard to himself Independent athlete Shane Slam Wise introduced a cuffedcradle of the ball prior to initiating the under the leg transfer and finishing with twohands While a number of players have finished the dunk using one or twohands with their backs to the rim perhaps the most renowned variant of the dunk is the combination with a  or simply stated a betweenthelegs Due to the athleticism and hangtime required the dunk is a crowd favorite and is heralded by players as the preeminent of all dunksElbow HangThe player approaches the basket and leaps as they would for a generic dunk Instead of simply dunking the ball with one or two hands the player allows their forearms to pass through the basket hooking their elbow pit on the rim before hanging for a short period of time Although the dunk was introduced by Vince Carter in the  NBA Slam Dunk contest Kobe Bryant was filmed performing the dunk two years earlier in  at an exhibition in the Philippines and during the  offseason at Magic Johnsons A Midsummer Nights Magic charity event as well as Roy Hinson who performed the dunk during warmups for the  NBA Slam Dunk contest Colloquially the dunk has a variety of names including honey dip cookie jar and elbow hookIn the  NBA contest Los Angeles Clippers powerforward Blake Griffin completed a selfpass off of the backboard prior to elbowhanging on the rim A number of other variants of the elbow hang have been executed including a lob selfpass hanging by the arm pit a windmill and over a person Most notable are two variations which as of July  have yet to be duplicated In  Canadian athlete Justin Darlington introduced an iteration aptly entitled a doubleelbow hang in which the player inserts both forearms through the rim and subsequently hangs on both elbows pits Circa  French athlete Guy Dupuy demonstrated the ability to perform a betweenthelegs elbow hang however Guy opted not to hang on the rim by his elbow likely because the downward moment could have resulted in injuryAlleyoopAn alleyoop dunk as it is colloquially known is performed when a pass is caught in the air and then dunked The application of an alleyoop to a slam dunk occurs in both games and contests In games when only fractions of a second remain on the game or shot clock an alleyoop may be attempted on inbound pass because neither clock resumes counting down until an inbounds player touches the ball The images to the right depict an interval spanning  of a secondOtherJames White in the  NCAA Slam Dunk Contest successfully performed tomahawk and windmill variations of the foulline dunk Though he was unable to complete a betweenthelegs from the foul line at that contest he has been known to execute it on other occasionsIn the  NBA Slam Dunk Contest Jamario Moon leaped from the foulline then using his nondominant hand caught and dunked a bouncepass from teammate Jason KaponoIndependent  North American athlete Eric Bishop introduced a dunk entitled the Paint Job The title is in reference to the key on a basketball court often known as paint in common parlance Approaching along the baseline with a running dribble Bishop jumped with onefoot at the border of the key dunked with onehand

a phraseOne of many sports idioms the phrase slam dunk is often used outside of basketball to refer colloquially to something that has a certain outcome or guaranteed success a sure thingThis is related to the high probability of success for a slam dunk versus other types of shots Additionally to be dunked on or to get posterized is sometimes popularly used to indicate that a person has been easily embarrassed by another in reference to the embarrassment associated with unsuccessfully trying to prevent an opponent from making a dunk This ascension to popular usage is reminiscent of for
